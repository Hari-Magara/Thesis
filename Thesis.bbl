      \field{abstract}{With the increased use of cold-formed lightweight steel framing (LSF), there is growing demand for the proper assessment of its performance in building fires. In partnership with the North American steel industry, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) is conducting an experimental and analytical study on the fire resistance of loadbearing cold-formed steel-framed wall and floor assemblies. As part of this collaboration, this literature survey summarizes the information available on the topics related to the fire resistance of loadbearing cold-formed steel-stud walls clad with gypsum board. The current practice of establishing their fire-resistance rating, based on full-scale furnace tests, is assessed. Previous experimental and analytical studies on the subject and on the thermal and mechanical properties of the constituent materials--steel, gypsum board, and insulation--at elevated temperatures are also discussed. Future research needs are identified in the context of recent performance-based fire safety engineering concepts.}

      \field{abstract}{In fire engineering analysis, one of the open problem is the transfer of thermal parameters obtained by fire CFD model to FEM models for structural analysis. In this study the new useful concept of “Adiabatic Surface Temperature” or more commonly known as AST, introduced by Wickstr{ö}m, is investigated. The adiabatic surface temperature offers the opportunity to transfer both thermal information of the gas and the net heat flux to the solid phase model, obtained by CFD analysis. In this study two CFD analyses are carried out in order to evaluate the effect of emissivity and of convective heat transfer coefficient to determine the AST. First one CFD analysis simulating a fire scenario, “conjugate heat transfer”, with a square steel beam exposed to hot surface is carried out to calculate AST, heat convective coefficient and temperature field in the beam. Second one, a conductive analysis is carried out on “standalone beam” imposing a third type boundary condition on its boundaries assuming the AST, evaluated in the conjugate analysis, as external temperature. Different heat convective coefficients are imposed on the beam walls. The comparison between results obtained by means of the two proposed analyses shows the use of AST as transfer thermal parameter between CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) and FEM (Finite Element Method) models is appropriate when the convective heat transfer coefficient is properly evaluated.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper describes a combined numerical analysis of heat and mass transfer in gypsum plasterboard when exposed to fire. The outputs of this analysis include temperature, moisture content and pressure distributions in gypsum plasterboard. Validation of the analysis is provided by comparing the numerical temperature distributions with experimental results with the comparisons showing good agreement. A parametric study is then carried out to study the effect of moisture content on heat transfer in gypsum plasterboard. The results of this study are used to derive an approximate value of specific heat of plasterboard to be used in heat transfer analysis only.}

      \field{abstract}{The paper presents a strategy to develop a fully transient numerical model of a heat transfer in building, using a transient CFD model of indoor air and a thermal envelope model, running in a co-simulation. The strategy relies on the utilization of RANS with a high-Re turbulence model and a wall function, which enables to use a coarse computational mesh limiting the computational time. Since wall functions give invalid heat transfer coefficients in thermally developing indoor air regions and the exact location of these regions is not known in indoor spaces, a new air-wall heat transfer calibration procedure is adopted in the co-simulation. It is assumed that there is a uniform surface-averaged and time-dependent heat transfer coefficient per surface, extracted from the CFD solution. The calibration procedure is based on the near-wall mesh density adjustment to obtain surface-average heat transfer coefficients close to those calculated from empirical relationships for natural and forced convection. No local heat transfer coefficients are checked and no dimensionless wall distances y+ are monitored during the simulation. Due to the calibration it is ensured that the average air-wall heat transfer rate is accurate despite the use of wall functions. The capabilities of the model developed based on the strategy are presented in the case study: the analysis of the influence of wall thermal capacitance on indoor environment in a single well-ventilated room. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

      \field{abstract}{Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) walls are commonly used in building construction. In general, they are lined with single or double layers of gypsum plasterboards with and without cavity insulation. Gypsum plasterboards act as a thermal barrier to protect the thin-walled steel studs from rapid temperature rise. In these walls, plasterboard joints are located along the studs for ease of construction and are protected by filler materials. During fires, these plasterboard joints crack and open up, and thus allow the stud temperatures to rise rapidly and initiate premature structural failures in LSF walls. This research investigated the detrimental effects of these plasterboards joints on the fire resistance rating of single and double plasterboard lined walls based on the hot flange time-temperature profiles of studs from full scale fire tests. To overcome the detrimental effects of plasterboard joints, the back-blocking technique was used, where plasterboard joints were placed between studs with 150 mm wide plasterboards as back-blocks. Full scale fire tests and numerical studies were performed on single plasterboard lined load bearing LSF wall panels to investigate the improved fire performance by using this technique. They showed that the fire resistance rating of these LSF walls was increased by 25{\%} in comparison to the conventional plasterboard joint arrangement over the studs. This paper presents the details of this research on the detrimental effects of plasterboard joints on the fire resistance of load bearing LSF walls, and the results. It also includes a discussion and results for non-load bearing LSF walls.}

      \field{abstract}{Light gauge Steel Framed (LSF) wall panels are essential components in the construction of residential and commercial buildings. They are used as load bearing and non-load bearing walls in low and mid-rise buildings. During fire events, LSF wall lining material acts as a thermal barrier against fire propagation through the wall and protects the thin-walled steel studs from higher temperatures. Many detailed studies have been conducted to investigate the thermal and structural behaviour of gypsum plasterboard lined load bearing LSF walls exposed to fire conditions. However, such studies are limited for non-load bearing LSF walls. The behavioural characteristics of non-load bearing LSF walls are different from those of load bearing walls with only insulation or integrity failures governing their fire design. Small-scale non-load bearing wall fire tests do not simulate the actual fire behaviour, rather they only provide comparative results for tests conducted under identical conditions. This paper presents the details of a detailed experimental study conducted on the fire performance of 3 m high non-load bearing LSF walls, and the results. Full-scale standard fire tests were conducted and the effects of gypsum plasterboard thickness, wall configurations and noggings on the fire performance of non-load bearing walls were quantified. Fire test results were compared based on the measured stud and gypsum plasterboard temperatures. This paper has provided very useful fire test data for use in the fire design of non-load bearing LSF walls, which can also be used in developing advanced thermal finite element models and their calibration.}

      \field{abstract}{Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) walls made of cold-formed steel stud and track sections and lined with gypsum plasterboards are commonly used in buildings as load bearing members. During fire events, gypsum plasterboards act as a thermal barrier and delay the temperature rise in the steel studs. Fire usually occurs on one side of LSF walls during which a non-uniform temperature distribution is developed across the steel stud cross-section. This results in thermal bowing deformations and non-uniform distribution of strength and stiffness within the studs. In most situations, fires are extinguished well before excessive or permanent plastic deformations of studs and/or stud failures occur. Hence the LSF wall frames could be re-used provided their residual capacities after fire events are adequate. This paper presents a study aimed at determining the residual compression capacities of LSF wall studs following fire exposure. A full scale standard fire test of LSF wall panel was conducted first, followed by a series of short column tests of lipped channel studs obtained from the tested LSF wall panel. Finite element analyses of the tested studs were undertaken using the measured post-fire mechanical properties of cold-formed steels. The residual compression capacities of these fire exposed short columns were also predicted using the ambient temperature cold-formed steel design rules. A numerical parametric study was then undertaken for 3 m long studs in LSF wall panels with varying wall configurations following an exposure to standard fire. This paper presents the details of these experimental and numerical studies of fire exposed LSF wall panels and the results. It demonstrates the potential of re-using LSF wall frames following fire exposures and provides appropriate limits for fire exposure time and stud hot flange temperature for three commonly used LSF wall configurations.}

      \field{abstract}{Light gauge steel framed (LSF) walls are used in fire compartmentation to prevent the spread of fire, smoke and toxic gases. The fire behavioural characteristics of non-load bearing LSF walls are different from those of load bearing walls. In non-load bearing LSF walls, fire penetration to the ambient side is to be prevented for insulation and integrity criteria whereas in load bearing walls, steel studs need to be protected from heat for structural adequacy also. This paper investigates the fire resistance of non-load bearing and load bearing LSF walls with and without cavity insulation. It presents the details of a series of standard fire tests conducted to investigate the effect of cavity insulation in both load bearing and non-load bearing LSF walls. The use of cavity insulation increased the fire resistance level (FRL) of non-load bearing walls, while it significantly reduced the FRL of load bearing walls. A finite element parametric study was then conducted for LSF walls lined with both single and double layers of plasterboards. Both thermal and structural fire performance results of LSF walls from finite element analyses are presented and compared in this paper. These results showed that FRL of cavity insulated non-load bearing LSF walls increases by 10–20 min, while it is significantly reduced for load bearing LSF walls with load ratios below 0.7. This study highlights both the beneficial and detrimental effects of cavity insulated LSF walls exposed to fire.}

      \field{abstract}{Thin-walled floor joists in LSF floor panels are protected by gypsum plasterboards and are subjected to a non-uniform temperature distribution across their cross-section in fires. Fire tests have shown that the failure of floor panels was governed by the section moment capacity of joists governed by local buckling effects. This research was aimed at developing simple design rules to predict the failure times (fire resistance) of LSF floors made of lipped channel section joists exposed to standard fires. The use of ambient temperature section modulus led to over-estimation of the moment capacity as the mechanical properties of steel varied across the joist cross-section while deteriorating with increasing joist temperatures in fires. New simplified fire design rules were proposed to determine the section moment capacities of joists at elevated temperatures based on the current cold-formed steel design specifications. Their accuracy was verified using finite element analysis and fire test results.}

      \field{abstract}{This dissertation is intended to provide technical information on the behavior, modeling and design of cold-formed steel (CFS) subjected to fire, grounded on experimental studies and engineering-based numerical analysis of CFS materials, members, connections, and systems at elevated temperatures. The experimental program presented herein includes tensile tests on CFS materials typically used in American and Brazilian building industries; connection tests to determine the stiffness of stud-to-sheathing connections; and column tests on bare and sheathed studs at elevated temperatures. Numerical analysis using the finite strip and finite element methods aims to provide a better understanding of the behavior of CFS members under fire. Numerical results are validated with experimental data, and used to judge the feasibility of current Direct Strength Method (DSM) column equations for fire design applications. Proposed models include equations to estimate the mechanical properties and stress-strain relations for CFS at elevated temperatures, and retention factors for the stiffness of stud-to-sheathing connections. Fire design of CFS based on modest modification to the current DSM is also proposed. Temperature-dependent material models are applied to the numerical study of CFS partition and load-bearing walls, using temperature data from standard fire tests. Results show the development of thermal bowing of walls, and joint opening between sheathing boards under simulated standard fire test conditions. These results potentially provide feedback to couple thermal and mechanical analyses of CFS wall systems. The findings of this work pertain the growth of engineering-based structural analysis method, as a building block for the development of performance-based fire design of CFS structures. Research needs are identified and listed in this document. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.)}

      \field{abstract}{This paper provides an overview of the Generalised Beam Theory (GBT) fundamentals and reports on the novel formulations and applications recently developed at the TU Lisbon: the use of conventional GBT to derive analytical distortional buckling formulae and extensions to cover (i) the buckling behaviour of members with (i1) branched, closed and closed/branched cross-sections and (i2) made of orthotropic and elastic-plastic materials, and (ii) the vibration and post-buckling behaviours of elastic isotropic/orthotropic members. In order to illustrate the usefulness and potential of the new GBT formulations, a few numerical results are presented and briefly discussed. Finally, some (near) future developments are briefly mentioned.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper presents the mechanical properties data for cold-formed steel at elevated temperatures. The deterioration of the mechanical properties of yield strength (0.2{\%} proof stress) and elastic modulus are the primary properties in the design and analysis of cold-formed steel structures under fire. However, values of these properties at different temperatures are not well reported. Therefore, both steady and transient tensile coupon tests were conducted at different temperatures ranged approximately from 20 to 1000 °C for obtaining the mechanical properties of cold-formed steel structural material. This study included cold-formed steel grades G550 and G450 with plate thickness of 1.0 and 1.9 mm, respectively. Curves of elastic modulus, yield strength obtained at different strain levels, ultimate strength, ultimate strain and thermal elongation versus different temperatures are plotted and compared with the results obtained from the Australian, British, European standards and the test results predicted by other researchers. A unified equation for yield strength, elastic modulus, ultimate strength and ultimate strain of cold-formed steel at elevated temperatures is proposed in this paper. A full strain range expression up to the ultimate tensile strain for the stress–strain curves of cold-formed carbon steel at elevated temperatures is also proposed in this paper. It is shown that the proposed equation accurately predicted the test results.}

      \field{abstract}{Cold-formed steel (CFS) wall systems were increasingly used as primary load-bearing structural components in residential and industrial buildings. Previous studies were mainly to investigate the fire performance of non-load bearing CFS wall systems lined with gypsum plasterboards. In order to improve the fire performance of load-bearing CFS wall systems more efficiently, this paper presented a detailed experimental investigation on five full-scale CFS walls lined with double layers of three different fire resistant panels on both sides, including fire-resistant gypsum plasterboard, bolivian magnesium board and calcium silicate board. The results showed a noticeable disadvantage of the calcium silicate board due to explosive spalling at high temperatures, and this might cause severe safety issues in an actual fire situation. For CFS walls lined with gypsum plasterboard as the face layer and bolivian magnesium board as the base layer on both sides, different load ratios may result in different failure modes, and the fire resistance time would be more than 90 min when the load ratio was less than 0.65. It was also demonstrated that the fire performance of bolivian magnesium board was superior to that of the fire resistant gypsum plasterboard, therefore the former may be recommended to be used in CFS structures to replace gypsum plasterboards as the base layer. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{Although a few fire experiments have been carried out on load-bearing cold-formed steel (CFS) wall systems, the understanding of their fire performance is still limited, and further parametric analysis on the basis of such experiments is expensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a simplified numerical approach to predicting the thermal and mechanical responses of CFS wall systems in fire. Thermal physical property experiments were carried out to measure the essential material properties. With those material properties as inputs, a one-dimensional thermal response model was developed to predict the heat transfer across the cross section of CFS wall systems. Both heat convection and radiation were considered in the thermal boundary conditions. The governing equation was expressed in the form of implicit finite-differential equations and solved using the Gauss-Seidel method. The model predictions of temperature responses of CFS wall systems were in good agreement with the measured temperature responses in the fire experiments and also compared well with the modeling results in literature with improved efficiency and convergence in computation. In addition, a thermomechanical response model was developed to predict the time-dependent lateral deflection and fire resistance time for CFS wall systems in fire and was validated by the experimental results in literature. All these studies provide an efficient approach for the fire performance analysis of load-bearing CFS wall systems. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}

      \field{abstract}{In order to improve the fire performance of load-bearing CFS wall systems for applications in mid-rise buildings, different panels and external insulation were examined in this paper. Experiments on six full-scale CFS wall specimens were performed in which the insulation material of aluminum silicate wool was located outside the CFS frame and sandwiched between two layers of boards on the fire side instead of being placed in the cavity. Five types of panels were involved in the experiments, including gypsum plasterboard, bolivian magnesium board, oriented standard boards (OSB), autoclaved lightweight concrete (ALC) boards and rock wool boards. The results showed a noticeable reduction of heat transfer to the surface of steel stud and a considerable improvement of fire performance of CFS walls by using aluminum silicate wool as external insulation. For CFS walls with aluminum silicate wool as external insulation on fire side, gypsum plasterboard as face layer and bolivian magnesium board as base layer on both sides, different load ratios may result in different failure modes, and the fire resistant time can be more than 150 min when the load ratio was less than 0.65. It was also demonstrated that the fire performance of CFS wall systems lined with bolivian magnesium board or ALC boards were superior to those lined with gypsum plasterboard and OSB. Therefore, bolivian magnesium board may be recommended to replace gypsum plasterboards as the base layer and ALC board may be used to replace OSB as exterior wall panels of CFS wall systems for applications in mid-rise buildings.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper presents a numerical investigation on the buckling behaviour of plasterboard protected CFS channel-section beams subjected to uniformly distributed loads when exposed to fire on its one side. The work involves three phases, namely heat transfer analysis, pre-buckling analysis and buckling analysis. The heat transfer analysis is accomplished using two-dimensional finite element analysis methods, from which the temperature fields of the channel-section beams are obtained. The pre-buckling analysis is completed using the Bernoulli bending theory of beams with considering the effects of temperature on strain and mechanical properties. The buckling analysis is performed using combined finite strip analysis and classical Fourier series solutions, in which the mechanical properties are considered to be temperature dependent. The results show that there are significant temperature variations in web, fire exposed flange and lip. Also, it is found that the buckling behaviour of the beam with temperature variation in its section is quite different from that of the beam with a constant uniform temperature in its section.}

      \field{abstract}{A review of height extrapolation methods used in the past, by BRANZ, has shown that complex techniques based on temperature rises inducing deflections, curvature and detachment of studs from channels can be reduced to a simple empirical formula. Given that a wall system comprising a certain stud and lining configuration has to be proven by a fire resistance test, a premise that the same or closely similar thermal and structural conditions will be reproduced within the wall is the basis of the proposed method. Four key features (of height, stud depth, lining and temperature difference across the studs) affecting the general performance of a wall were examined to determine some key dependencies and isolate irrelevant parameters from further consideration. This approach was possible by taking a macroscopic view of a system as a whole, and by assuming for all height and stud depth combinations of a given system that the behaviour is similar and predictable to a high degree.

      \field{abstract}{Light gauge steel-framed (LSF) walls are used as load bearing and non-load bearing building components in traditional concrete framed buildings and emerging all-steel structures. Recent building fire disasters around the world have highlighted the necessity for improved fire performance in such building components. While the fire performance of gypsum plasterboard, magnesium oxide board, calcium silicate board and oriented strand board (OSB) sheathed LSF walls has been assessed using fire tests and numerical analyses in the past, fire performance of steel sheathed walls remains unknown. Steel sheathing can improve the in-plane shear capacity of steel framed walls and is an accepted lateral load carrying system with widespread applications in the cold-formed steel construction industry. This paper presents the results of a series of small-scale fire tests conducted on steel and gypsum plasterboard sheathed composite panels and framed walls, and also an enthalpy based analytical study using the experimental results. Provision of steel sheathing either only internally, only externally or both internally and externally in combination was found to enhance the fire performance of plasterboard panels and plasterboard framed walls. The confinement of water within plasterboards for a prolonged duration with the provision of steel sheathing was found to be the prime cause of this improvement. Furthermore, the formation of thermal bridges across the stud in cavity insulated walls was found to reduce the fire performance significantly.}

      \field{abstract}{Fire performance of plasterboard lined Light-gauge Steel Framed (LSF) walls has been investigated using numerical and experimental studies in the past. However, past research has been limited to lipped channel sections (LCS) and welded hollow flange channel (HFC) sections. This paper investigates the fire performance of LSF walls made of a new web-Stiffened Channel Section (SCS) stud using numerical models, validated using available fire test results. The SCS succeeds in eliminating both local and distortional buckling when used as 3 m long LSF wall studs at ambient temperature. Ambient temperature compression capacity evaluations showed that the performance of the SCS is equivalent to the welded HFC, but is superior to the LCS. Fire performance of load bearing and non-load bearing LSF walls made with each of the three stud sections was assessed for three common wall configurations using thermal and structural finite element analyses. Extended FRL versus Load Ratio curves were developed using a combination of steady state and transient state coupled temperature-displacement analyses. The results showed that the effect of stud geometry on the fire performance of LSF wall configurations is minimal. Under the same load ratio, all three stud sections perform similarly in each of the wall configurations. Considering the ambient and fire performance results, the reduced cost and also the potential double connectivity to plasterboard via its lip elements, the SCS is recommended for use in LSF walls. This paper has also highlighted the susceptibility of non-load bearing LSF walls to fail in fire under structural inadequacy.}

      \field{abstract}{Light gauge steel-framed (LSF) walls, commonly made with lipped channel studs and gypsum plasterboard sheathing, are increasingly being used in low to mid-rise buildings. Improvements have been made with respect to fire, wind/seismic and energy performance of LSF walls with the use of improved stud sections, wall configurations, different sheathing members, and insulation materials. Although the provision of sheet steel as sheathing has been found to improve the in-plane shear capacity of LSF walls, its effects on the fire performance of load bearing walls remain unknown. Three full-scale ISO 834 standard fire tests were conducted in this study to investigate the fire performance of axially loaded gypsum plasterboard and steel sheathed LSF walls made with web-stiffened studs. The results revealed that compared to the commonly used lipped channel stud, the web-stiffened stud is capable of withstanding a 57{\%} greater axial compression load, yet yield the same fire resistance level (FRL), when sheathed only with two layers of gypsum plasterboard. Under the selected load ratio, the addition of steel sheathing caused only marginal improvements in the stud temperature development, resulting in minor improvements to the FRL of load bearing walls. However, the axial load bearing capacity improvement caused by the inclusion of steel sheathing allowed the web-stiffened stud to withstand a 10{\%} greater axial compression load compared to the plasterboard only wall.}

      \field{abstract}{Light gauge steel-framed (LSF) walls, commonly made with lipped channel studs and gypsum plasterboard sheathing, are increasingly being used in low to mid-rise buildings. Improvements have been made with respect to fire, wind/seismic and energy performance of LSF walls with the use of improved stud sections, wall configurations, different sheathing members, and insulation materials. Although the provision of sheet steel as sheathing has been found to improve the in-plane shear capacity of LSF walls, its effects on the fire performance of load bearing walls remain unknown. Three full-scale ISO 834 standard fire tests were conducted in this study to investigate the fire performance of axially loaded gypsum plasterboard and steel sheathed LSF walls made with web-stiffened studs. The results revealed that compared to the commonly used lipped channel stud, the web-stiffened stud is capable of withstanding a 57{\%} greater axial compression load, yet yield the same fire resistance level (FRL), when sheathed only with two layers of gypsum plasterboard. Under the selected load ratio, the addition of steel sheathing caused only marginal improvements in the stud temperature development, resulting in minor improvements to the FRL of load bearing walls. However, the axial load bearing capacity improvement caused by the inclusion of steel sheathing allowed the web-stiffened stud to withstand a 10{\%} greater axial compression load compared to the plasterboard only wall.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper presents the results of eight tests on loaded full-scale cold-formed thin-walled steel structural panels, two tests at ambient temperature and six exposed to the standard fire condition on one side. The test panels used two types of lipped channels, 100×54×15×1.2 mm or 100×54×15×2 mm, each channel having two service holes, one near the top and one near the bottom. Three different load levels, being 0.2, 0.4 and 0.7 times the load carrying capacity of the same panel tested at ambient temperature, were applied during the six fire tests. At ambient temperature, failure was local buckling around the top service hole. Under fire condition, the main failure mode was overall flexural–torsional buckling about the major axis, with the lateral deformations of the test panels being mainly caused by thermal bowing due to temperature gradients. The interior insulation in some tests was burnt through and this had noticeable influence on temperature developments in the test steel channels. In two fire tests using the thinner channels, the test panels failed before 30 min that is considered to be the minimum standard fire rating of this type of construction.}

      \field{abstract}{The companion paper has presented results of elevated temperature tests on 52 cold-formed thin-walled channels under compressive load. This paper presents the results of theoretical studies using a number of different calculation tools, these including simple design calculations based on modifying a few current design methods and a commercial finite element package ABAQUS. The design methods considered in this paper include the British standard BS5950 Part 5, Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 and the American Specification AISI. Modifications of the current design equations are made to enable them to include distortional buckling, the effects of service holes and elevated temperatures. To enable BS5950 Part 5 and Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 to predict the ultimate strength of thin-walled columns with a service hole, the AISI (1996) design method is introduced. To extend the capacity of these design methods to deal with distortional buckling failure mode, the method of Young, Kwon and Hancock for calculating distortional buckling capacity is introduced in these codes. Finally, the ambient temperature design methods are modified to take into account changes in the strength and stiffness of steel at elevated temperatures. From extensive comparisons between the results of tests, code predictions and numerical analyses, it may be concluded that by adopting the aforementioned modifications, the current code design methods can be easily modified to consider these advanced modes of behaviour. For finite element analyses, both geometrical and material non-linearities are taken into account. The high temperature stress–strain relationships of steel are determined according to Eurocode 3, Part 1.2 or Outinen et al.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper presents the results of a numerical investigation into the axial strength of cold-formed thin-walled channel sections (columns) under non-uniform high temperatures in fire. The non-uniform temperature distributions are based on the results of a thermal analysis of thin-walled stud panels carried out by the authors. The general finite-element package ABAQUS is used to obtain strengths of columns with different lengths at different fire exposure times. To aid development of a hand calculation method of column strength in fire, the accuracy of using two ways of simplifying the non-uniform temperature distribution is investigated. The ambient temperature design method for cold-formed thin-walled columns in Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 (EN1993-1-3, Eurocode 3: design of steel structures, Part 1.3: general rules, supplementary rules for cold formed thin gauge members and sheeting, European Commission for Standardisation, Brussels, 2001) is modified to take into account the change in the strength and stiffness of steel at elevated temperatures and thermal-bowing effects. The results of this design method are compared to the ABAQUS simulation results. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{Cold-formed thin-walled steel sections are usually used in planar structural systems with insulation on both sides. Due to their small thickness, when exposed to fire, they dissipate heat to the surrounding quickly, leading to rapid temperature increases. Also because they employ planar fire protection and are usually exposed to fire attack from one side, a significant temperature gradient through the cross-section of a thin-walled member can be induced. A temperature gradient may also be present in the width direction because thin-walled members lose heat rapidly to their surroundings. As a result, temperature distributions in a thin-walled steel section can be highly non-uniform under fire conditions. Furthermore, the thermal performance of the steel section will depend on the presence or otherwise of the protective layers, usually made from gypsum boards, which may not always stick to the steel section due to possible integrity failure. In this study, the thermal performance of thin-walled steel channel sections in a planar system under fire attack from one side has been investigated both experimentally and numerically. In the experimental study, fire tests were conducted on eight steel stud panels with different types of steel section, different number of gypsum boards and either with or without interior insulation. The numerical study was performed by first validating the capabilities of a commercially available general finite element program ABAQUS. Afterwards, ABAQUS was used to carry out a parametric study to investigate the thermal performance of steel stud systems with different numbers of gypsum boards on the exposed and unexposed sides and that of cassette systems. Results of these investigations indicate that the thermal performance of cold-formed thin-walled steel channel wall panels are not significantly affected by the type of interior insulation and the shape of the cold-formed thin-walled steel cross-section. Temperatures of the steel section of a steel stud panel system depend primarily on insulation panels on the fire exposed side. A cassette section, which has a wide web (300–400mm), two flanges and two narrow webs, is an alternative to conventional steel stud to eliminate cross-bracing. The thermal performance of this type of wall system is greatly affected by its layout, i.e. whether the continuous steel sheet is on the fire exposed side or the unexposed side. Temperatures in the steel cassette section are higher if the continuous sheet is on the fire exposed side.}

      \field{abstract}{Light steel-frame building systems are becoming more prevalent in commercial, industrial and residential construction in New Zealand. Tested fire resistance ratings are generally available for non-load-bearing systems, but not for load-bearing applications. This study investigates the performance of load-bearing light steel-frame systems exposed to fire. Methods are presented for calculating the reduction of steel strength and stiffness at elevated temperatures, and for predicting the deflections resulting from temperature gradients and P-$\Delta$ effects. Heat transfer modelling by computer is used to predict steel framing temperatures for systems exposed to the standard ISO 834 time-temperature curve and real fires. Three full-scale furnace tests were carried out to evaluate analytical predictions. A design procedure is proposed.}

      \field{abstract}{The thermal behavior of a commercially widespread gypsum board (810 kg/m 3) under fire condition has been investigated. For this purpose two 12 mm thick gypsum boards are subjected to the standard fire ISO 834 and the temperature distribution within them is measured by means of thermocouples placed at different depths in the samples. The results hereof are used to validate a numerical model based on the density, thermal conductivity, and effective heat capacity of the gypsum board as functions of temperature. The effects of dehydration/calcination and decomposition on these properties are determined by using thermogravimetric analysis, conductivity measurements after different heat treatments, and differential scanning calorimetry under air flow, respectively.}

      \field{abstract}{Cold-formed steel members have been widely used in residential and commercial buildings as primary load bearing structural elements. They are often made of thin steel sheets and hence they are more susceptible to local buckling. The buckling behaviour of cold-formed steel compression members under fire conditions is not fully investigated yet and hence there is a lack of knowledge on the fire performance of cold-formed steel compression members. Current cold-formed steel design standards do not provide adequate design guidelines for the fire design of cold-formed steel compression members. Therefore a research project based on extensive experimental and numerical studies was undertaken to investigate the local buckling behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel compression members under simulated fire conditions. First a series of 91 local buckling tests was conducted at ambient and uniform elevated temperatures up to 700 °C on cold-formed lipped and unlipped channels. Suitable finite element models were then developed to simulate the behaviour of tested columns and were validated using test results. All the ultimate load capacity results for local buckling were compared with the predictions from the available design rules based on AS/NZS 4600, BS 5950 Part 5, Eurocode 3 Parts 1.2 and 1.3 and the direct strength method (DSM), based on which suitable recommendations have been made for the fire design of cold-formed steel compression members subject to local buckling at uniform elevated temperatures.}

      \field{abstract}{Light Gauge Steel Framing (LSF) walls made of cold-formed and thin-walled steel lipped channel studs with plasterboard linings on both sides are commonly used in commercial, industrial and residential buildings. However, there is limited data about their structural and thermal performance under fire conditions while past research showed contradicting results about the benefits of using cavity insulation. A new composite wall panel was recently proposed to improve the fire resistance rating of LSF walls, where an insulation layer was used externally between the plasterboards on both sides of the wall frame instead of using it in the cavity. In this research 11 full scale tests were conducted on conventional load bearing steel stud walls with and without cavity insulation, and the new composite panel system to study their thermal and structural performance under standard fire conditions. These tests showed that the use of cavity insulation led to inferior fire performance of walls, and provided supporting research data. They demonstrated that the use of insulation externally in a composite panel enhanced the thermal and structural performance of LSF walls and increased their fire resistance rating. This paper presents the details of the LSF wall tests and the thermal and structural performance data and fire resistance rating of load-bearing wall assemblies lined with varying plasterboard-insulation configurations under two different load ratios. Fire test results including the time–temperature and deflection profiles are presented along with the failure times and modes.}

      \field{abstract}{Traditionally the fire resistance rating of LSF wall systems is based on approximate prescriptive methods developed using limited fire tests. Therefore a detailed research study into the performance of load bearing LSF wall systems under standard fire conditions was undertaken to develop improved fire design rules. It used the extensive fire performance results of eight different LSF wall systems from a series of full scale fire tests and numerical studies for this purpose. The use of previous fire design rules developed for LSF walls subjected to non-uniform elevated temperature distributions based on AISI design manual and Eurocode3 Parts 1.2 and 1.3 was investigated first. New simplified fire design rules based on AS/NZS 4600, North American Specification and Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 were then proposed in this study with suitable allowances for the interaction effects of compression and bending actions. The importance of considering thermal bowing, magnified thermal bowing and neutral axis shift in the fire design was also investigated. A spread sheet based design tool was developed based on the new design rules to predict the failure load ratio versus time and temperature curves for varying LSF wall configurations. The accuracy of the proposed design rules was verified using the test and FEA results for different wall configurations, steel grades, thicknesses and load ratios. This paper presents the details and results of this study including the improved fire design rules for predicting the load capacity of LSF wall studs and the failure times of LSF walls under standard fire conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Light Gauge Steel Framing (LSF) walls are made of cold-formed, thin-walled steel lipped channel studs with plasterboard linings on both sides. However, these thin-walled steel sections heat up quickly and lose their strength under fire conditions despite the protection provided by plasterboards. A new composite wall panel was recently proposed to improve the fire resistance rating of LSF walls, where an insulation layer was used externally between the plasterboards on both sides of the wall frame instead of using it in the cavity. A research study using both fire tests and numerical studies was undertaken to investigate the structural and thermal behaviour of load bearing LSF walls made of both conventional and the new composite panels under standard fire conditions and to determine their fire resistance rating. This paper presents the details of finite element models of LSF wall studs developed to simulate the structural performance of LSF wall panels under standard fire conditions. Finite element analyses were conducted under both steady and transient state conditions using the time-temperature profiles measured during the fire tests. The developed models were validated using the fire test results of 11 LSF wall panels with various plasterboard/insulation configurations and load ratios. They were able to predict the fire resistance rating within 5. min. The use of accurate numerical models allowed the inclusion of various complex structural and thermal effects such as local buckling, thermal bowing and neutral axis shift that occurred in thin-walled steel studs under non-uniform elevated temperature conditions. Finite element analyses also demonstrated the improvements offered by the new composite panel system over the conventional cavity insulated system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Light gauge steel frame wall systems are commonly used in industrial and commercial buildings, and there is a need for simple fire design rules to predict their load capacities and fire resistance ratings. During fire events, the light gauge steel frame wall studs are subjected to non-uniform temperature distributions that cause thermal bowing, neutral axis shift and magnification effects and thus resulting in a combined axial compression and bending action on the studs. In this research, a series of full-scale fire tests was conducted first to evaluate the performance of light gauge steel frame wall systems with eight different wall configurations under standard fire conditions. Finite element models of light gauge steel frame walls were then developed, analysed under transient and steady-state conditions and validated using full-scale fire tests. Using the results from fire tests and finite element analyses, a detailed investigation was undertaken into the prediction of axial compression strength and failure times of light gauge steel frame wall studs in standard fires using the available fire design rules based on Australian, American and European standards. The results from both fire tests and finite element analyses were used to investigate the ability of these fire design rules to include the complex effects of non-uniform temperature distributions and their accuracy in predicting the axial compression strength of wall studs and the failure times. Suitable modifications were then proposed to the fire design rules. This article presents the details of this investigation on the fire design rules of light gauge steel frame walls and the results.}

      \field{abstract}{The performance of gypsum plasterboard assemblies is typically evaluated in accordance with standardised test methods such as BS476, AS1530 or ASTM E119. Standard time-temperature curves give good comparison between tested materials. However, they are generally less severe than a typical short duration compartment fire, they do not have a decay phase, and may be conservative for long duration fires. It is not common knowledge that test time-temperature relationships, such as ISO834, have not significantly changed since they were originally formulated in the early 1930's. Full-scale compartment testing based on typical residential scenarios conducted as part of this study, revealed that temperatures within a compartment can far exceed those of standard time-temperature curves within several minutes of ignition. Pilot-scale furnace testing to non-standard time-temperature curves has revealed that the performance of light framed gypsum plasterboard assemblies is highly dependent on the severity of the fire exposure. A system that has achieved a fire resistance rating of 60 minutes failed within 30 minutes to a fire exposure that would represent a moderate compartment fire. Current fire engineering designs often use sophisticated evacuation models to calculate minimum escape times required for safe evacuation of occupants. These evacuation times typically fall in the range from 15 - 60 minutes. The suitability of protecting escape routes using barriers rated against a standard fire test is questioned. SAPIR, a powerful finite element program, has been employed to predict the thermal behaviour of various gypsum plasterboard assemblies exposed to a range of nonstandard fires. Results from the computer modelling are compared with several full and pilot scale furnace tests. It was found that the model calibrated to results from standard ISO834 furnace testing provided reasonable predictions of temperatures within assemblies exposed to a moderate fire. Temperature predictions of assemblies exposed to severe fires were poor.}

      \field{abstract}{Mechanical properties have an important role in the fire safety design of cold-formed steel structures due to the rapid reduction in mechanical properties such as yield strength and elastic modulus under fire conditions and associated reduction to the load carrying capacities. Hence there is a need to fully understand the deterioration characteristics of yield strength and elastic modulus of cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures. Although past research has produced useful experimental data on the mechanical properties of cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures, such data do not yet cover different cold-formed steel grades and thicknesses. Therefore, an experimental study was undertaken to investigate the elevated temperature mechanical properties of two low and high strength steels with two thicknesses that are commonly used in Australia. Tensile coupon tests were undertaken using a steady state test method for temperatures in the range 20–700 °C. Test results were compared with the currently available reduction factors for yield strength and elastic modulus, and stress–strain curves, based on which further improvements were made. For this purpose, test results of many other cold-formed steels were also used based on other similar studies undertaken at the Queensland University of Technology. Improved equations were developed to predict the yield strength and elastic modulus reduction factors and stress–strain curves of a range of cold-formed steel grades and thicknesses used in Australia. This paper presents the results of this experimental study, comparisons with the results of past research and steel design standards, and the new predictive equations.}

      \field{abstract}{Recently an innovative composite panel system was developed, where a thin insulation layer was used externally between two plasterboards to improve the fire performance of light gauge cold-formed steel frame walls. In this research, finite-element thermal models of both the traditional light gauge cold-formed steel frame wall panels with cavity insulation and the new light gauge cold-formed steel frame composite wall panels were developed to simulate their thermal behaviour under standard and realistic fire conditions. Suitable apparent thermal properties of gypsum plasterboard, insulation materials and steel were proposed and used. The developed models were then validated by comparing their results with available fire test results. This article presents the details of the developed finite-element models of small-scale non-load-bearing light gauge cold-formed steel frame wall panels and the results of the thermal analysis. It has been shown that accurate finite-element models can be used to simulate the thermal behaviour of small-scale light gauge cold-formed steel frame walls with varying configurations of insulations and plasterboards. The numerical results show that the use of cavity insulation was detrimental to the fire rating of light gauge cold-formed steel frame walls, while the use of external insulation offered superior thermal protection to them. The effects of real fire conditions are also presented.}

      \field{abstract}{Gypsum plasterboards are commonly used as a fire safety material in the building industry. Many research studies have been undertaken to investigate the thermal behaviour of plasterboards under standard fire conditions. However, there are many discrepancies in relation to the basic thermal properties of plasterboards while simple equations are not available to predict the ambient surface time–temperature profiles of gypsum plasterboard panels that can be used in simulating the behaviour and strength of steel studs or joists in load bearing LSF wall and floor systems. In this research, suitable thermal properties of plasterboards were proposed based on a series of tests and available results from past research. Finite element models of gypsum plasterboard panels were then developed to simulate their thermal behaviour under standard fire conditions. The accuracy of the proposed thermal properties and the finite element models was validated by comparing the numerical results with available fire test results of plasterboard panels. This paper presents the details of the finite element models of plasterboard panels, the thermal analysis results from finite element analyses under standard fire conditions and their comparisons with experimental results.}

      \field{abstract}{In recent times, light gauge steel frame (LSF) wall systems are increasingly used in the building industry. They are usually made of cold-formed and thin-walled steel studs that are fire-protected by two layers of plasterboard on both sides. A composite LSF wall panel system was developed recently, where an insulation layer was used externally between the two plasterboards to improve the fire performance of LSF wall panels. In this research, finite element thermal models of the new composite panels were developed using a finite element program, SAFIR, to simulate their thermal performance under both standard and Eurocode design fire curves. Suitable apparent thermal properties of both the gypsum plasterboard and insulation materials were proposed and used in the numerical models. The developed models were then validated by comparing their results with available standard fire test results of composite panels. This paper presents the details of the finite element models of composite panels, the thermal analysis results in the form of time-temperature profiles under standard and Eurocode design fire curves and their comparisons with fire test results. Effects of using rockwool, glass fibre and cellulose fibre insulations with varying thickness and density were also investigated, and the results are presented in this paper. The results show that the use of composite panels in LSF wall systems will improve their fire rating, and that Eurocode design fires are likely to cause severe damage to LSF walls than standard fires.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]}

      \field{abstract}{Fire resistant and load bearing Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems are generally made of cold-formed steel stud sections lined with gypsum plasterboards. Structural stability of these steel frames at elevated temperatures is important for the load bearing LSF walls for survival during fire events. The studs in these frames are usually Lipped Channel Section (LCS) studs. However, there are other more structurally efficient stud sections such as the hollow flange section studs, which can be effectively used in LSF walls. However, lack of fire research on these sections has inhibited their usage in LSF walls. This paper proposes the use of hollow flange channel (HFC) section studs in LSF walls with a view to increase their fire resistant ratings (FRR). In this study, five full scale fire tests of LSF walls made of welded hollow flange channel section studs were conducted under standard fire conditions. Three different wall configurations and three load ratios were considered in these tests. This paper presents the details of fire tests and their results including the time-temperature profiles of plasterboard and steel stud surfaces, lateral displacement and axial deformation profiles, failure modes and failure temperatures. It also presents the effects of using different wall configurations and load ratios on the FRR of LSF walls. Comparison of the fire performance of LSF walls made of welded HFC section studs with those made of conventional LCS studs demonstrated the superior fire performance through the use of welded HFC section studs.}

      \field{abstract}{Cold-formed Hollow Flange Channel (HFC) sections can be used in Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems due to their structural efficiency. Recent experimental and finite element analysis based investigations conducted by the authors have demonstrated the superior fire performance of LSF walls made of welded HFC sections. The authors have developed a wide range of fire performance data of LSF walls through a finite element analysis (FEA) based extensive parametric study. This paper investigates the applicability of the available fire design rules to predict their structural capacities. Since fire design rules were not available for HFC sections, the latest design rules for LCS studs subjected to non-uniform temperature distributions were selected for evaluation from the pool of various design rules given in standards and previous studies. Suitable modifications were then incorporated for simplification and improved accuracy. Two improved design methods based on AS/NZS 4600 and Eurocode 3 were proposed. The structural capacity of HFC section stud found from the design rule predictions was converted into load ratio which is the ratio between the structural capacities under fire and ambient conditions, and the load ratio versus FRR curve were produced for different LSF walls. These were then compared with the FEA results, to verify the accuracy of the proposed design rules. This paper also presents suitable DSM based design method proposed for HFC section studs subject to non-uniform temperature distributions in LSF walls, and verifies its accuracy.}

      \field{abstract}{Fire resistance of load bearing Light Gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems is important to protect lives and properties in fire accidents. Recent fire tests of LSF walls made of the new cold-formed and welded hollow flange channel (HFC) section studs and the commonly used lipped channel section (LCS) studs have shown the influence of stud sections on the fire resistance rating (FRR) of LSF walls. To advance the use of HFC section studs and to verify the outcomes from the fire tests, finite element models were developed to predict the structural fire performance of LSF walls made of welded HFC section studs. The developed models incorporated the measured non-uniform temperature distributions in LSF wall studs due to the exposure of standard fire on one side, and accurate elevated temperature mechanical properties of steel used in the stud sections. These models simulated the various complexities involved such as thermal bowing and neutral axis shift caused by the non-uniform temperature distribution in the studs. The finite element analysis (FEA) results agreed well with the full scale fire test results including the FRR, outer hot and cold flange temperatures at failure and axial deformation and lateral displacement profiles. They also confirmed the superior fire performance of LSF walls made of HFC section studs. The applicability of both transient and steady state FEA of LSF walls under fire conditions was verified in this study, which also investigated the effects of using various temperature distribution patterns across the cross-section of HFC section studs on the FRR of LSF walls. This paper presents the details of this numerical study and the results.}

      \field{abstract}{Typical load-bearing light gauge steel frame (LSF) walls are made of conventional lipped channel section studs and gypsum plasterboards. Current research at the Queensland University of Technology is investigating the effects of using new thin-walled stud sections on the fire-resistant rating of LSF walls, in particular, the use of hollow flange channel (HFC) sections. A sound knowledge on the thermal performance of these LSF walls is essential, but expensive and time-consuming nature of fire tests has acted as a barrier. In this study, finite element models were developed to predict the thermal performance of load-bearing LSF walls made of HFC section studs exposed to fire on one side. The developed models were validated using the results of five full-scale standard fire tests of LSF walls. They were then extended to perform a parametric study where the effects of stud dimensions, geometries, spacings and wall configuration were evaluated. The hot and cold flange time-temperature profiles of HFC studs were developed as a function of the aforementioned parameters, which can be used to predict the fire resistance ratings of LSF walls. This paper presents the fire tests, and the details of the developed finite element models and the thermal performance results of LSF walls made of HFC studs.

      \field{abstract}{Load-bearing Light Gauge Steel Frame (LSF) walls are made of cold-formed steel frames and lined with fire-resistant gypsum plasterboards, and include cavity insulation based on energy performance requirements. Despite the importance of their fire performance, the current fire design methods rely mostly on a prescriptive approach, which relies on fire resistance ratings (FRR) provided by the wall manufacturers due to the lack of knowledge of the various parameters affecting the fire performance of LSF walls. This paper identifies the parameters affecting the fire performance of LSF walls, and presents a detailed review of the fire performance of LSF walls as a function of these parameters, based on recent research studies. It discusses the effects of elevated temperature thermal properties, plasterboard fall-off, cavity insulation, wall configuration, and stud section shapes on the thermal performance of LSF walls, and presents a detailed study of the temperature distribution patterns across the stud cross-sections. Negative effects of plasterboard joints are also demonstrated using fire test results. Elevated temperature mechanical properties of steel, time–temperature profiles of walls, stud section shapes and their sizes were found to be affecting the structural performance of LSF walls in fire, and their effects are discussed. The importance of using accurate elevated temperature mechanical properties in determining the FRR of LSF walls is also demonstrated. A good understanding of the identified parameters on the fire performance of LSF walls can lead to the use of a performance-based fire design method, and development of LSF walls with enhanced fire performance.}

      \field{abstract}{Local buckling under fire conditions needs to be considered in the context of a wider range of cross-sectional slenderness than in ambient temperatures design. This is due to the distinctly non-linear material behaviour of steel at elevated temperatures, and the large strains required for increasing cross-sectional capacity due to plastification. Stress-based design models, which are commonly used to explain local buckling at ambient temperatures, are not ideal for describing local buckling behaviour under fire conditions. Therefore a new strain-based approach has been developed which uses effective widths for stiffened and unstiffened elements at elevated temperatures. The resulting strain-based formulations avoid the use of section classes for fire design, and take into consideration the plastification effects, plastic stress distribution, and strain-dependent non-linear material behaviour of steel at high temperatures. The use of these formulations extends the application range of current state-of-the-art models for local buckling and non-linear material behaviour. They allow us to consider the decreasing branch of the load-carrying behaviour required during fires, in order to analyse sections with non-uniform temperature distribution. For unstiffened elements in compression at elevated temperatures, the load-carrying behaviour in the buckling and post-buckling ranges was analysed using temperature-dependent second-order linear elastic theory, taking into consideration initial imperfections and yield line theory, which allowed us to formulate a novel strength curve for these elements at elevated temperatures. In a parametric study, the resistance to compression and bending of stiffened and unstiffened elements during fire was calculated. The proposed design approach accords with results produced using the finite element approach.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper presents the effect of various factors on the fire resistance of load-bearing, gypsum board protected, steel stud wall assemblies. A detailed experimental study was conducted to evaluate the fire resistance of 14 full-scale steel stud wall assemblies. Both single row and double row steel stud configurations with installation of gypsum board on each of the exposed and unexposed sides, and with and without insulation in the cavity, were considered in the experimental program. The insulation used were glass, rock and dry blown cellulose fibers. Data from the experimental program are used to determine the effects of stud-spacing, shear membrane, load intensity, resilient channel installation, insulation type and gauge thickness of studs on the fire resistance of gypsum board-protected, steel stud wall assemblies. Results from the studies show that the insulation type and number of gypsum board layers have significant influence on the fire resistance of steel stud wall assemblies. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]}

      \field{abstract}{This report presents the results of an experimental study on the fire resistance of lightweight steel-framed (LSF) assemblies, conducted at the National Research Council of Canada in collaboration with industry partners. A total of 14 full-scale fire resistance tests were conducted on loadbearing gypsum board-protected, steel stud wall assemblies. The wall assemblies had either diagonal cross-bracing or shear membrane to enhance shear resistance to lateral loads. Both single row and double row steel stud configurations with installation of gypsum board on each of the fire exposed and unexposed sides were considered in the experimental program. The insulation used, within the wall assemblies, were glass, rock and dry-blown cellulose fibers. Some of the wall assemblies were provided with resilient channels, often used in wall designs to improve their sound transmission classification (STC) ratings, to study their effect on the fire resistance of steel stud walls. These tests were conducted to determine the effects of stud arrangement, crossbracing or shear membrane, load intensity, resilient channel installation, insulation type and thickness of studs on the fire resistance of gypsum board-protected, steel stud wall assemblies. Details of the results, including the temperatures and deflections measured during the fire resistance tests, are presented.

      \field{abstract}{Gypsum plasterboard wall assemblies are extensively used as cladding material for walls, floors and ceilings, as well as a means for passive fire protection of timber structures. The good fire resistance characteristics of gypsum plasterboards are mainly owed to the gypsum “dehydration” process, occurring between 80 °C and 250 °C, where large quantities of energy are absorbed by evaporating water molecules, bound in the gypsum's crystal lattice. Aiming to enhance the prediction quality of numerical simulation tools, utilized to support the performance-based fire design of modern buildings, a gypsum dehydration numerical model is developed and validated. The model focuses on accurately describing the physical and chemical phenomena characterizing the gypsum dehydration process by employing a modelling approach based on solid reaction kinetics; temperature-dependent thermo-physical properties are also taken into account. The developed model is implemented in a Computational Fluid Dynamics code. Numerical results are validated by comparison to available temperature measurements obtained in a gypsum plasterboard wall assembly tested in a small-scale fire resistance furnace. Predictions of the developed model are found to agree reasonably well with the experimental data; a series of parametric studies is also performed aiming to investigate the effect of various modelling parameters.}

      \field{abstract}{Fire safety of buildings has been recognised as very important by the building industry and the community at large. Traditionally, increased fire rating is provided by simply adding more plasterboards to light gauge steel frame (LSF) walls, which is inefficient. Many research studies have been undertaken to investigate the thermal behaviour of traditional LSF stud wall systems under standard fire conditions. However, no research has been undertaken on the thermal behaviour of LSF stud walls using the recently proposed composite panel. Extensive fire testing of both non-load bearing and load bearing wall panels was conducted in this research based on the standard time-temperature curve in AS1530.4. Three groups of LSF wall specimens were tested with no insulation, cavity insulation and the new composite panel based on an external insulation layer between plasterboards. This paper presents the details of this experimental study into the thermal performance of non-load bearing walls lined with various configurations of plasterboard and insulation. Extensive descriptive and numerical results of the tested non-load bearing wall panels given in this paper provide a thorough understanding of their thermal behaviour, and valuable time-temperature data that can be used to validate numerical models. Test results showed that the innovative composite stud wall systems outperformed the traditional stud wall systems in terms of their thermal performance, giving a much higher fire rating.}

      \field{abstract}{Gypsum plasterboards are commonly used to protect the light gauge steel-framed walls in buildings from fires. Single or multiple plasterboards can be used for this purpose, whereas recent research has proposed a composite panel with a layer of external insulation between two plasterboards. However, a good understanding of the thermal behaviour of these plasterboard panels under fire conditions is not known. Therefore, 15 small-scale fire tests were conducted on plasterboard panels made of 13 and 16 mm plasterboards and four different types of insulations with varying thickness and density subject to standard fire conditions in AS 1530.4. Fire performance of single and multiple layers of gypsum plasterboards was assessed including the effects of interfaces between adjacent plasterboards. Effects of using external insulations such as glass fibre, rockwool and cellulose fibre were also determined. The thermal performance of composite panels developed from different insulating materials of varying densities and thicknesses was examined and compared. This paper presents the details of the fire tests conducted in this study and their valuable time-temperature data for the tested plasterboard panels. These data can be used for the purpose of developing and validating accurate thermal numerical models of these panels. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{This article investigates the thermal performance of gypsum boards in the dehydration temperature region, where pronounced chemical reactivity is anticipated. Gypsum board samples were gradually heated up to 300°C, using a low heating rate. Temperature measurements at pre-selected board locations indicated three distinct stages of gypsum dehydration; free moisture evaporation, transformation of calcium sulfate dihydrate to calcium sulfate hemi-hydrate and of calcium sulfate hemi-hydrate to calcium sulfate anhydrate. Physical properties of the gypsum board sample, that is density, specific heat, and thermal conductivity, were measured as a function of the dehydration temperature range. Results suggested that the thermal conductivity of the calcium anhydrate sulfate is higher than that of the hemi-hydrate, despite the fact that gypsum porosity increases during the dehydration process. Based on the experimental results, correlations for the thermal conductivity and the dehydration energy as a function of the mass loss during the dehydration process and the initial water content of the gypsum board, respectively, were obtained.}

      \field{abstract}{This study aims to analyse the importance of gypsum plasterboard cardboard for fire resistance. A new hypothesis considering the failure based on the cardboard degradation is defined. This hypothesis comes from the thermal analysis of gypsum and cardboard performed in the simultaneous thermal analysis apparatus. Simultaneous thermal analysis results also allow defining the dehydration process of the gypsum. A numerical model that considers gypsum dehydration and the failure hypothesis has been developed by using Fire Dynamic Simulator. This numerical model is validated against 6 fire resistance tests. Results show that we can appropriately tune the numerical model (for predicting time to failure) based on the thermal properties of cardboard.}

      \field{abstract}{Gypsum plasterboards are widely used for compartmentation and for retarding the spread of fire in buildings. Although numerous heat transfer studies have been conducted, literature indicates there are extensive differences in the thermal properties used in these studies. Comprehensive experimental and numerical analyses have been conducted to elucidate the leading factor in the ablation of a gypsum board system when it is exposed to the standard fire resistance test. A methodology based on both simultaneous thermal analysis and computational modelling is proposed to understand the behaviour of a gypsum plasterboard when the boundary temperature increases quickly as one side of the wall is subjected to the standard ISO 834. Finally, four different wall assemblies made of a commercial fireproof plasterboard system are exposed to the standard test. The temperature on the unexposed face is examined to validate the computational model of the plasterboard. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Principles of mathematical models as tools in engineering and science are discussed in relation to turbulent combustion modeling. A model is presented for the rate of combustion which takes into account the intermittent appearance of reacting species in turbulent flames. This model relates the rate of combustion to the rate of dissipation of eddies and expresses the rate of reaction by the mean concentration of a reacting specie, the turbulent kinetic energy and the rate of dissipation of this energy. The essential features of this model are that it does not call for predictions of fluctuations of reacting species and that it is applicable to premixed as well as diffusion flames. The combustion model is tested on both premixed and diffusion flames with good results. Special attention is given to soot formation and combustion in turbulent flames. Predictions are made for two C2 H2 turbulent diffusion flames by incorporating both the above combustion model and the model for the rate of soot formation developed by Tesner et al., as well as previous observations by Magnussen concerning the behavior of soot in turbulent flames. The predicted results are in close agreement with the experimental data. All predictions in the present paper have been made by modeling turbulence by the k-∈ model. Buoyancy is taken into consideration in the momentum equations. Effects of terms containing density fluctuations have not been included. © 1977 Combustion Institute.}

      \field{abstract}{The work aims in the problem of numerical analysis of steel structures under natural fire. The emphasis is put on the proper calculation of temperature field inside the structural members and, in particular, the non-uniform temperature distribution inside the section. Thus, the main contribution is the coupling method between computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA). Coupling is done by dedicated scripts, which utilize developed methods and compute the heat transfer between gas and solid phase. The example of simple steel structure under different fire scenarios is presented. Conclusions presenting advantages of proposed procedure are given.}

      \field{abstract}{A series of real-scale compartment tests was performed to provide information on the phenomenology of partition response and failure, to guide model development. Two partition assemblies of 2.44 m × 2.44 m were exposed to two intense fires from the time of ignition to beyond flashover. The assemblies were constructed using type X gypsum panels. The stud spacing and stud dimensions were fixed for both assemblies. Heat flux gauges provided time histories of the energy incident on the partitions, while thermocouples provided data on the propagation of heat through the partitions and on the progress toward perforation. Visual and infrared cameras were used to image partition behavior during the fire exposure. The results obtained from these experiments are discussed. Published in 2005 by John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{A gypsum wall assembly was exposed to an intense real-scale compartment fire. For the wall assembly, temperatures were measured at the exposed face, within the stud cavity, and at the unexposed face during the fire exposure. Total heat flux gauges were used to measure the temporal variation of the energy incident on the walls, and cameras, both visual and infrared, were used to image the unexposed face of the wall assembly during the fire exposure.

      \field{abstract}{To facilitate the development of cost-effective and flexible design options there is a need to develop models to predict the fire resistance of wood-frame building assemblies. Such assemblies often derive much of their fire resistance from a protective membrane composed of gypsum board. A simple two-dimensional computer model is presented to predict heat transfer through gypsum-board/wood-stud walls exposed to fire. Input data for the thermophysical properties of gypsum board were measured exploying standard bench-scale tests. Input data for wood were selected from the literature. Small-and full-scale fire resistance tests were conducted on gypsum-board/wood-stud wall assemblies to provide data for the validation of the model. The model is shown to predict heat transfer through these walls rather well.}

      \field{abstract}{In this paper, the authors present experimental observations and results of full scale standard fire tests as well as thermo-mechanical sequentially coupled finite element simulations on partition walls. A procedure for carrying out numerical simulation of the coupled-thermo-mechanical behaviour is proposed. The numerical models presented for predicting behaviour during fires were calibrated and verified by full scale fire testing. The test wall was constructed using steel C-section studs with gypsum boards fixed on both sides. The wall cavity was filled with Rockwool insulation. The partition wall was tested during exposure to the standard fire test. The thermo-mechanical behaviour of the wall was found to be heavily coupled and influenced by the physical and chemical changes in all constituents of the wall during exposure to fire. The sequentially coupled mechanical response simulation included geometric and material non-linearity as a function of temperature. In spite of the complexity of the fire effects and the strongly coupled thermo- mechanical behaviour, the results of the computational model practically agree with the full scale experimental results. The numerical prediction of the maximum thermal bowing of the wall was found to be very similar to the maximum values measured during the fire test. This has practical implications for assessing the integrity such wall assemblies during exposure to elevated temperatures. The proposed procedure can be used by fire structural engineers and fire testing laboratories as a tool to assist technical assessment exercises. In addition, the proposed procedure can be used during the developmental and modification stages of building components to optimise performance during fire. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{Prefabricated lightweight aerated concrete (PLAC) panels provide low thermal conductivity, potentially high stiffness-to-weight ratios, cost-effective material and structural systems and rapid modular construction. These panels can be utilised as floor slabs or external walls for various applications in building construction. The fire performance of the PLAC panel is examined in this work for a particular case, namely a prefabricated emergency bushfire shelter, which is one of the key applications of PLAC panels. Since, bushfires have unique heating curves, standardised tests are not useful and the system needs to be tested in a manner such that the heat flux of an actual bush fire can be reproduced. In this study, the fire performance enhancement of dual-skin bushfire bunkers, which are comprised of lightweight concrete and base metal thickness (BMT) steel, are examined experimentally and validated numerically. The Speedpanel PLAC modular panel explored in this work is a lightweight wall system primarily used for acoustic and thermal insulation purposes. Burning experimental studies of a single panel and dual-skin bunkers are carried out on a full scale. The experimental results are compared with fire safety codes for building materials to identify the key areas for improvements. A fire dynamic numerical model has been developed in this work using the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) to simulate the burning process of PLAC structures. Numerical results of heat production are presented in comparison with experimental observations for validating the computational model. The proposed numerical model is used to predict the fire performance of a dual-skin bushfire bunker, demonstrating the need to have at least two PLAC layers to ensure fire safety compliance.}

      \field{abstract}{The topic of this paper is the fire safety analysis of 3D frame structures such as industrial halls. Cold-formed thin plated elements are used as structural components. The building, which is submitted to a full-scale fire test, is introduced. A blind prediction analysis is performed using the finite element model SAFIR. The thermal response of the structural elements under both a standard fire and a natural fire corresponding to a fire load density of 625 MJ/m2 and an opening factor 0.009 m1/2 is predicted. As expected, the temperature of the cold-formed sections follows more or less the gas temperature in the fire compartment due to the thin plates. The results of the predicted mechanical response are presented, giving a resistance of 27 min (standard fire) and 54 min (natural fire). The model is validated based on the results of the full-scale fire test, demonstrating a fire resistance of 62 min. Comparison with a simple 2.5D model is made and proved to provide results sufficiently accurate to make it applicable for daily design practice.}

      \field{abstract}{In recent times, light gauge cold-formed steel sections have been used extensively since they have a very high strength to weight ratio compared with thicker hot-rolled steel sections. However, they are susceptible to various buckling modes including a distortional mode and hence show complex behaviour under fire conditions. Therefore, a research project based on detailed experimental studies was undertaken to investigate the distortional buckling behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel compression members under simulated fire conditions. More than 150 axial compression tests were undertaken at uniform ambient and elevated temperatures. Two types of cross sections were selected with nominal thicknesses of 0.60, 0.80, and 0.95 mm. Both low (G250) and high (G550) strength steels were used. Distortional buckling tests were conducted at six different temperatures in the range of 20–800 ∘C. The ultimate loads of compression members subject to distortional buckling were then used to review the adequacy of the current design rules at ambient and elevated temperatures. This paper presents the details of this experimental study and the results.}

      \field{abstract}{In recent times, light gauge cold-formed steel sections have been used extensively as primary load-bearing structural members in many applications in the building industry. Fire safety design of structures using such sections has, therefore, become more important. Deterioration of mechanical properties of yield stress and elasticity modulus is considered the most important factor affecting the performance of steel structures in fires. Hence, there is a need to fully understand the mechanical properties of light gauge cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures. A research project based on experimental studies was, therefore, undertaken to investigate the deterioration of mechanical properties of light gauge cold-formed steels. Tensile coupon tests were undertaken to determine the mechanical properties of these steels made of both low- and high-strength steels and thicknesses of 0.60, 0.80 and 0.95 mm at temperatures ranging from 20 to 800 °C. Test results showed that the currently available reduction factors are unsafe to use in the fire safety design of cold-formed steel structures. Therefore, new predictive equations were developed for the mechanical properties of yield strength and elasticity modulus at elevated temperatures. This paper presents the details of the experimental study, and the results including the developed equations. It also includes details of a stress–strain model for light gauge cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures.}

      \field{abstract}{Cold-formed steel (CFS) is increasingly used in building construction in many countries due to its lightweight and fast and easy construction characteristics. However, its fire resistance is not well understood, which may restrict its applications. For fire design purposes, a good knowledge of the elevated temperature mechanical properties of CFS is essential. Although several useful studies have been conducted on the mechanical properties of CFS, the elevated temperature reduction factors vary significantly among them while no predictive equation is available to calculate the proportional limit stress of CFS at elevated temperatures. Moreover, they also show significant variations between the elevated temperature reduction factors of cold-rolled steel sheets and CFS sections. In this research, low and high strength cold-rolled steel sheets and high strength CFS lipped channel sections and floor decks were tested in the temperature range of 20–700 °C under isothermal conditions to determine the reductions in their mechanical properties. Predictive equations given in AS/NZS 4600 for yield strength and Young's modulus were verified, and new predictive equations for ultimate strength, stress at 2{\%} total strain, 0.05{\%} proof stress and proportional limit stress were proposed. Finally, a two-stage stress-strain model was proposed to accurately predict the stress-strain curves of CFS at ambient and elevated temperatures.}

      \field{abstract}{Recently, Magnesium Oxide (MgO) board has been widely used in LSF wall systems because of its improved acoustic properties, impact resistance, structural strength and serviceability. However, their thermal properties and fire performance have not been fully investigated. Therefore, in this research study thermal properties of two different types of MgO boards available in Australia were measured and their fire performance was investigated using three full-scale fire tests of LSF walls lined with two types of MgO board. Although the tests were conducted on two different types of MgO boards with different configurations, the fire test results gave a fire resistance level (FRL) of 30 min, in which the failure was initiated by integrity of the board with either board cracking or board joint opening. This paper presents the details of the thermal property tests and the three full-scale fire tests, and their results. In addition, the effects of different MgO boards, joint configurations and compounds, noggings, screw fastening techniques and cavity insulation on the fire performance of LSF walls are also presented.}

      \field{abstract}{Cold-formed steel stud sections are commonly used as compression members in fire rated load-bearing light gauge steel frame (LSF) wall systems. Although conventional lipped channel section (LCS) studs are commonly used in LSF wall systems, there is a growing interest in developing innovative stud sections to increase the load carrying capacities when used in fire rated LSF wall systems. One such section is the web-stiffened section (WSS), which has increased load carrying capacities as well as enhanced acoustic properties. However, the applicability of the existing structural fire design rules has not been investigated for the WSS stud sections while the advantages of using such sections have not been demonstrated. Therefore, the structural behaviour of WSS stud sections was investigated under ambient and fire conditions using finite element analyses and their capacities were compared with those of conventional LCS studs. Three different LSF wall configurations and three stud thicknesses were considered for both stud sections. The applicability of existing structural fire design rules for LCS and WSS studs used in fire rated LSF wall systems was then investigated based on finite element analyses, effective width method and direct strength method. The results show that WSS studs have much higher load carrying capacities than LCS studs under ambient and fire conditions and that direct strength method based design rules are simpler to use than the effective width based design rules for the structural fire design of LSF wall systems made of both LCS and WSS studs. This paper presents the details of this investigation and the results.}

      \field{abstract}{Purpose - This research was aimed at investigating the fire performance of LSF wall systems by using 3-D heat transfer FEmodels of existing LSF wall system configurations. Design/methodology/approach - This research was focused on investigating the fire performance of LSF wall systems by using 3-D heat transfer finite element models of existing LSF wall system configurations. The analysis results were validated by using the available fire test results of five different LSF wall configurations. Findings - The validated finite element models were used to conduct a parametric study on a range of nonload bearing and load bearing LSF wall configurations to predict their fire resistance levels (FRLs) for varying load ratios. Originality/value - Fire performance of LSF wall systems with different configurations can be understood by performing full-scale fire tests. However, these full-scale fire tests are time consuming, labour intensive and expensive. On the other hand, finite element analysis (FEA) provides a simple method of investigating the fire performance of LSF wall systems to understand their thermal-mechanical behaviour. Recent numerical research studies have focused on investigating the fire performances of LSF wall systems by using finite element (FE) models. Most of these FE models were developed based on 2-D FE platform capable of performing either heat transfer or structural analysis separately. Therefore, this paper presents the details of a 3-D FEA methodology to develop the capabilities to perform fully-coupled thermal-mechanical analyses of LSF walls exposed to fire in future.}

A brief comparison of the Direct Strength Method with the Effective Width Method is provided. The advantage of methods that integrate computational stability analysis into the design process, such as the Direct Strength Method, is highlighted. The development of the Direct Strength Method for beams and columns, including the reliability of the method is provided. Current and ongoing research to extend the Direct Strength Method is reviewed and complete references provided. The Direct Strength Method was formally adopted in North American cold-formed steel design specifications in 2004 as an alternative to the traditional Effective Width Method. The appendices of this paper provide the Direct Strength Method equations for the design of columns and beams as developed by the author and adopted in the North American Specification. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{This paper assesses the applicability of the Direct Strength Method (DSM) to calculating the local buckling ultimate strength of cold-formed thin-walled (CF-TW) steel members with non-uniform elevated temperature distributions in the cross-section. The assessment was carried out by checking the DSM calculation results with numerical simulation results using the general finite element software ABAQUS which was validated against ambient and uniform elevated temperature tests on short lipped channel sections. The validated numerical model was used to generate an extensive database (372 models) of numerical results of load carry capacity of CF-TW members with different uniform and non-uniform temperature distributions in the cross-sections, under different boundary and loading conditions and with different dimensions and lengths. It was concluded that the DSM local buckling curve was directly applicable for columns with uniform temperature distributions in the cross-section. For columns with non-uniform temperature distributions, a modification to the local buckling curve was necessary and this paper has proposed a new curve.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper assesses the applicability of the Direct Strength Method (DSM) to calculating the distortional buckling strength of cold-formed thin-walled (CF-TW) steel members with uniform and non-uniform elevated temperature distributions in the cross-section. The assessment was carried out by checking the DSM calculation results with numerical simulation results using the general finite element software ABAQUS which was further validated against ambient and uniform elevated temperature tests on short lipped channel sections, in addition to the author's previous validation studies for thin-walled steel columns with non-uniform temperature distributions. The validated numerical model has been used to generate an extensive database (453) of numerical results of load carrying capacity of CF-TW members with different uniform and non-uniform temperature distributions in the cross-sections, under different boundary and loading conditions and with different dimensions and lengths. It is concluded that the existing DSM distortional buckling curve for ambient temperature application is also applicable for columns with uniform temperature distributions in the cross-section, but is un-conservative for columns with non-uniform temperature distributions in the cross-section. This paper proposes a modification to the distortional buckling curve to enable DSM to deal with distortional buckling in columns with non-uniform temperature distributions.}

      \field{abstract}{Fire design of cold-formed Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) systems requires an accurate assessment of the thermal properties of each component at elevated temperatures. Heat transfer models based on these properties are implemented in order to accurately simulate the thermal behaviour of LSF systems in fire. For all carbon steel components, thermal properties are presented in Eurocode 3 Part 1.2. To verify the accuracy of thermal properties in Eurocode 3 Part 1.2 for the cold-formed steel components used in LSF construction, a series of thermal property tests was conducted based on the ASTM standard test methods. Thermal property tests were conducted to determine the specific heat at constant pressure, relative density, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of three types of carbon steels, namely Grade 500 steel, Grade 300 steel and Grade 140 steel, due to their use in LSF construction. Test results showed the differences between the Eurocode 3 Part 1.2 model for carbon steels and the measured thermal property data for both specific heat and thermal conductivity of all three types of carbon steels due to chemical composition and the influence of carbon content. Hence, new equations were developed for specific heat and thermal conductivity for the selected carbon steels. To verify the effect of the measured thermal property results, 3-D heat transfer models of LSF floor-ceiling systems were developed and analysed. New thermal properties of carbon steels were used as inputs and comparisons made against fire test results for validation purposes. This paper presents the thermal properties of three selected carbon steels, which are commonly used in cold-formed LSF systems and the results.}

      \field{abstract}{The structural fire behavior of typical load-bearing drywall systems, consisting of light cold-formed steel (CFS) studs, sheathed with single or double layers of gypsum plasterboards and air cavity or mineral wool insulation, is investigated. For that purpose, an efficient numerical modeling approach with satisfying accuracy is developed and validated against experimental and numerical results available in the literature. Heat transfer and structural analyses of the investigated drywall assemblies are carried out, employing the computational tools ANSYS CFX and ADINA, respectively. Transient heat transfer analyses provide the spatial and temporal temperature variation over the drywall assembly, which is assumed to be exposed to the standard ISO 834 fire curve from one side. Thermal simulation results are then introduced in the subsequent structural analyses, where the load-bearing capacity of the CFS studs under fire conditions is estimated, by means of Geometry and Material Nonlinear Analyses accounting for Imperfections (GMNIA). The load-bearing capacity assuming uniform cross-sectional temperature distributions is also evaluated and compared to the respective predictions under non-uniform temperature profiles. Results obtained by varying the imposed load or the applied temperature (fire duration), are compared to predictions of existing and literature-proposed fire design guidelines. EN 1993-1-2 provisions lead to average underestimation of the load-bearing capacity by approximately 20{\%}, while the literature-proposed methods are found to underestimate the load-bearing capacity by 5{\%} to 15{\%}. The limitation of using a critical temperature of 350°C for the structural fire design of thin-walled sections is found to be rather conservative, since the investigated CFS studs are able to exhibit satisfying fire performance also under higher temperature conditions.}

      \field{abstract}{In the present study, a fully coupled thermo-mechanical simulation methodology is presented, capable of estimating the response of cold-formed steel drywall systems exposed to fire and evaluating whether or not compliance with the performance-based fire safety requirements is achieved, in terms of the load-bearing capacity (R), integrity (E) and insulation (I) criteria. The proposed nonlinear coupled thermo-mechanical approach, accounting for geometry, material and contact nonlinearities, is validated against full-scale furnace test results of typical, commercially available, load-bearing drywall systems, achieving a very good qualitative and quantitative agreement; maximum discrepancies between the predicted and measured fire-resistance ratings do not exceed 2{\%}. Several parametric studies are carried out, concerning the magnitude of the imposed load on the bearing walls and the effect of the cavity insulation placement on the overall fire performance of drywall systems. It is found that installation of thermal insulation inside the drywall cavity may decrease the system's fire-resistance rating, depending on the employed configuration. The proposed numerical approach can be effectively used to estimate the fire-resistance rating of load-bearing lightweight steel drywall systems in support of performance-based fire design standards.}

      \field{abstract}{A nonlinear finite element (FE) model is developed to simulate two series of flexural tests, previously conducted by the authors, on industry standard cold-formed steel C- and Z-section beams. The previous tests focused on laterally braced beams with compression flange details that lead predominately to local buckling failures, in the first test series, and distortional buckling failures, in the second test series. The objectives of this paper are to (i) validate the FE model developed for simulation of the testing, (ii) perform parametric studies outside the bounds of the original tests with a particular focus on variation in yield stress and influence of moment gradient on failures, and (iii) apply the study results to examine and extend the Direct Strength Method of design. The developed FE model shows good agreement with the test data in terms of ultimate bending strength. Extension of the tested sections to cover yield stresses from 228 to 506 MPa indicates that the Direct Strength Method is applicable over this full range of yield stresses. The FE model is also applied to analyze the effect of moment gradient on distortional buckling. It is found that the distortional buckling strength of beams is increased due to the presence of moment gradient. Further, it is proposed and verified that the moment gradient effect on distortional buckling failures can be conservatively accounted for in the Direct Strength Method by using an elastic buckling moment that accounts for the moment gradient. An empirical equation, appropriate for use in design, to predict the increase in the elastic distortional buckling moment due to moment gradient, is developed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
