abstract = {Fire resistance of Light Gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems is important in the emerging mid-rise cold-formed steel construction. Many studies have been conducted in recent times to improve the acoustic, thermal (energy) and fire performance of non-load bearing LSF walls. Increasing the wall cavity depth provides superior acoustic and thermal performance characteristics of LSF walls. LSF walls with increased cavity depth are constructed using different stud arrangements such as single, double and staggered rows of studs. Past research studies have been limited to non-load bearing LSF walls made of single row of steel studs with the same cavity depth of 90 mm. This paper investigates the fire resistance of single, double and staggered stud LSF walls with varying cavity depths under non-load bearing conditions. Four full-scale standard fire tests were conducted to investigate the effects of cavity depth for non-load bearing LSF walls and the results are presented in detail. Fire test results show that the temperatures across the wall depth decrease with increasing cavity depth. LSF walls with two layers of plasterboard lining and wider cavity resulted in increased fire resistance. This study also highlights the detrimental effects of staggered stud LSF wall arrangement causing structural failure of thin-walled steel studs.},

abstract = {We investigate heat transfer in a rarefied gas in a lid-driven cavity flow initiated by instantaneously heating and cooling opposite walls for different flow regimes. Volume diffusion model is used as an extension to the standard Navier–Stokes-Fourier set for simulating the flows. Numerical simulations are presented and compared with standard Navier–Stokes-Fourier. For higher Knudsen numbers the volume diffusion model captures non-local equilibrium effects in corners of the cavity that are missed by the Navier–Stokes-Fourier model. It is generally observed that one can use volume diffusion corrections to capture disequilibrium effects in high rarefaction regimes.},

abstract = {Coupled CFD fire simulations and thermomechanical FE analyses typically consist of fire simulations, heat transfer analyses and structural response analyses, mutually coupled by three coupling steps. There are two coupling approaches, one-way and two-way coupling, where two-way coupling includes the effects of the structural response on fire propagation. In the first part of this paper, one- and two-way coupling approaches including the coupling steps are proposed to include coupling at the structural level. Then a case study comprising an office space with a 12-plate thin-walled steel fa{\c{c}}ade under fire conditions is introduced, as well as the related CFD and FE models. A newly developed automated coupling interface and subprograms are used to perform several one-way and two-way coupled analyses using a coarse and fine CFD mesh for the case study. Slight differences are found in the results of identical simulations due to random effects in the fire simulations. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that two-way coupling is feasible, and that significant differences in the fa{\c{c}}ade failure progression illustrate its effectiveness. Future research includes additional developments of both the fire and structural models, as well as verification and parametric studies to further confirm the findings.},

abstract = {Gypsum plasterboards are commonly used to protect the light gauge steel-framed walls in buildings from fires. Single or multiple plasterboards can be used for this purpose, whereas recent research has proposed a composite panel with a layer of external insulation between two plasterboards. However, a good understanding of the thermal behaviour of these plasterboard panels under fire conditions is not known. Therefore, 15 small-scale fire tests were conducted on plasterboard panels made of 13 and 16 mm plasterboards and four different types of insulations with varying thickness and density subject to standard fire conditions in AS 1530.4. Fire performance of single and multiple layers of gypsum plasterboards was assessed including the effects of interfaces between adjacent plasterboards. Effects of using external insulations such as glass fibre, rockwool and cellulose fibre were also determined. The thermal performance of composite panels developed from different insulating materials of varying densities and thicknesses was examined and compared. This paper presents the details of the fire tests conducted in this study and their valuable time-temperature data for the tested plasterboard panels. These data can be used for the purpose of developing and validating accurate thermal numerical models of these panels. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.

abstract = {Light gauge steel-framed (LSF) walls are used as load bearing and non-load bearing building components in traditional concrete framed buildings and emerging all-steel structures. Recent building fire disasters around the world have highlighted the necessity for improved fire performance in such building components. While the fire performance of gypsum plasterboard, magnesium oxide board, calcium silicate board and oriented strand board (OSB) sheathed LSF walls has been assessed using fire tests and numerical analyses in the past, fire performance of steel sheathed walls remains unknown. Steel sheathing can improve the in-plane shear capacity of steel framed walls and is an accepted lateral load carrying system with widespread applications in the cold-formed steel construction industry. This paper presents the results of a series of small-scale fire tests conducted on steel and gypsum plasterboard sheathed composite panels and framed walls, and also an enthalpy based analytical study using the experimental results. Provision of steel sheathing either only internally, only externally or both internally and externally in combination was found to enhance the fire performance of plasterboard panels and plasterboard framed walls. The confinement of water within plasterboards for a prolonged duration with the provision of steel sheathing was found to be the prime cause of this improvement. Furthermore, the formation of thermal bridges across the stud in cavity insulated walls was found to reduce the fire performance significantly.},

abstract = {Fire resistance rating of light gauge steel frame (LSF) wall systems is obtained from fire tests based on the standard fire time-temperature curve. However, fire severity has increased in modern buildings due to higher fuel loads as a result of modern furniture and light weight constructions that make use of thermoplastics materials, synthetic foams and fabrics. Some of these materials are high in calorific values and increase both the spread of fire growth and heat release rate, thus increasing the fire severity beyond that of the standard fire curve. Further, the standard fire curve does not include a decay phase that is present in natural fires. Despite the increasing usage of LSF walls, their behavior in real building fires is not fully understood. This paper presents the details of a research study aimed at developing realistic design fire curves for use in the fire tests of LSF walls. It includes a review of the characteristics of building fires, previously developed fire time-temperature curves, computer models and available parametric equations. The paper highlights that real building fire time-temperature curves depend on the fuel load representing the combustible building contents, ventilation openings and thermal properties of wall lining materials, and provides suitable values of many required parameters including fuel loads in residential buildings. Finally, realistic design fire time-temperature curves simulating the fire conditions in modern residential buildings are proposed for the testing of LSF walls.},

abstract = {Wind and fire phenomena can together be a devastating force, whether in the case of a building fire, release of smoke in an urban area or forest fire near an urban habitat. Most of the fire phenomena are influenced by the wind, usually for the worse. If we want to understand fires, we have to understand wind as well, and model it appropriately. This modelling is described by the discipline of Computational Wind Engineering, from which we are able to transfer invaluable knowledge to coupled wind-fire analyses. This two-part review is dedicated to such a transfer. In Part I, the authors describe the historical and most current instances of wind and fire coupled modelling, referred to as simple models, in situ measurements, wind tunnel experiments or numerical studies with CFD. The review is subdivided into six categories, namely flame behaviour in wind conditions, indoor flows, natural smoke ventilators, tunnel ventilation, wildfires and firebrand transport, and urban dispersion of smoke. Besides flame behaviour, all remaining topics are covered, to the best of the authors' knowledge, with multiple references to valuable experimental and numerical studies. In Part II of the review, the authors describe the best practices of Computational Wind Engineering, that may be transferred to fire-oriented numerical studies. This part provides good practice guidelines, reference studies and a proposal for the optimisation of the simulation procedure for coupled wind and fire models.},

abstract = {In building applications (e.g. industrial, offices and residential), the use of lightweight steel-framed structural elements is increasing given its advantages, such as exceptional strength-to-weight relation, great potential for recycling and reuse, humidity shape stability, easy prefabrication and rapid on-site erection. However, the high thermal conductivity of steel presents a drawback, which may lead to thermal bridges if not well designed and executed. Furthermore, given the high number of steel profiles and its reduced thickness, it is not an easy task to accurately predict its thermal performance in laboratory and even less in situ. In a previous article, the authors studied the importance of flaking heat loss in lightweight steel-framed walls. This article discusses several thermal bridges mitigation strategies to improve a lightweight steel-framed wall model, which increase its thermal performance and reduce the energy consumption. The implementation of those mitigation strategies leads to a reduction of 8.3{\%} in the U-value, comparatively to the reference case. An optimization of the wall module insulation layers is also performed (e.g. making use of new insulation materials: aerogel and vacuum insulation panels), which combined with the mitigation approaches allows a decrease of 68{\%} in the U-value, also relatively to the reference case. Some design rules for lightweight steel-framed elements are also presented.},

abstract = {Cold-formed thin-walled steel sections are usually used in planar structural systems with insulation on both sides. Due to their small thickness, when exposed to fire, they dissipate heat to the surrounding quickly, leading to rapid temperature increases. Also because they employ planar fire protection and are usually exposed to fire attack from one side, a significant temperature gradient through the cross-section of a thin-walled member can be induced. A temperature gradient may also be present in the width direction because thin-walled members lose heat rapidly to their surroundings. As a result, temperature distributions in a thin-walled steel section can be highly non-uniform under fire conditions. Furthermore, the thermal performance of the steel section will depend on the presence or otherwise of the protective layers, usually made from gypsum boards, which may not always stick to the steel section due to possible integrity failure. In this study, the thermal performance of thin-walled steel channel sections in a planar system under fire attack from one side has been investigated both experimentally and numerically. In the experimental study, fire tests were conducted on eight steel stud panels with different types of steel section, different number of gypsum boards and either with or without interior insulation. The numerical study was performed by first validating the capabilities of a commercially available general finite element program ABAQUS. Afterwards, ABAQUS was used to carry out a parametric study to investigate the thermal performance of steel stud systems with different numbers of gypsum boards on the exposed and unexposed sides and that of cassette systems. Results of these investigations indicate that the thermal performance of cold-formed thin-walled steel channel wall panels are not significantly affected by the type of interior insulation and the shape of the cold-formed thin-walled steel cross-section. Temperatures of the steel section of a steel stud panel system depend primarily on insulation panels on the fire exposed side. A cassette section, which has a wide web (300–400 mm), two flanges and two narrow webs, is an alternative to conventional steel stud to eliminate cross-bracing. The thermal performance of this type of wall system is greatly affected by its layout, i.e. whether the continuous steel sheet is on the fire exposed side or the unexposed side. Temperatures in the steel cassette section are higher if the continuous sheet is on the fire exposed side.},

abstract = {Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) walls made of cold-formed steel stud and track sections and lined with gypsum plasterboards are commonly used in buildings as load bearing members. During fire events, gypsum plasterboards act as a thermal barrier and delay the temperature rise in the steel studs. Fire usually occurs on one side of LSF walls during which a non-uniform temperature distribution is developed across the steel stud cross-section. This results in thermal bowing deformations and non-uniform distribution of strength and stiffness within the studs. In most situations, fires are extinguished well before excessive or permanent plastic deformations of studs and/or stud failures occur. Hence the LSF wall frames could be re-used provided their residual capacities after fire events are adequate. This paper presents a study aimed at determining the residual compression capacities of LSF wall studs following fire exposure. A full scale standard fire test of LSF wall panel was conducted first, followed by a series of short column tests of lipped channel studs obtained from the tested LSF wall panel. Finite element analyses of the tested studs were undertaken using the measured post-fire mechanical properties of cold-formed steels. The residual compression capacities of these fire exposed short columns were also predicted using the ambient temperature cold-formed steel design rules. A numerical parametric study was then undertaken for 3 m long studs in LSF wall panels with varying wall configurations following an exposure to standard fire. This paper presents the details of these experimental and numerical studies of fire exposed LSF wall panels and the results. It demonstrates the potential of re-using LSF wall frames following fire exposures and provides appropriate limits for fire exposure time and stud hot flange temperature for three commonly used LSF wall configurations.},

abstract = {ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is currently in design phase of the nuclear fusion research project, which is the world's largest experimental tokamak reactor. Process of plasma generation in the Vacuum Vessel requires an ultra-high quality of vacuum. To meet those requirements the Vacuum Vessel and adjacent diagnostic systems are exposed to elevated temperature after its assembly to outgas all volatile surface contaminants. The baking temperature peaks at 240°C for up to 24 hours. On the other side most of diagnostic instruments and detectors adjacent to the Vacuum Vessel, which are exposed to the same conditions, require much lower temperature during measurement and slightly higher temperature in a stand-by mode. The strictest conditions are defined for liquid scintillators, which require the working temperature around 20°C and the temperature of destruction several degrees higher. In order to keep diagnostic instruments within required temperature range, a heat shield with a heat removal is necessary. The temperature range is often ± 2°C or even more narrow in time and space allotted for detectors. Due to space limitations only a thin multilayer solution, including vacuum layers, can be considered. Preliminary calculations indicate that to meet the above defined requirements, only a water jacket as the heat shield can be efficient enough to keep detectors at the required temperature level and within defined range. An additional multilayer vacuum insulation can significantly decrease the cooling demand for the water jacket cooling system. The aim of proposed paper is to find an optimal structure of the insulation thermal shield, based on the water jacket solution by using the CFD simulation in ANSYS Fluent software. Moreover an extended Parametric Analysis is carried out and discussed. The Surface-to-Surface (S2S) model is applied to simulate heat transfer by radiation. In addition the paper contains a discussion about multilayer solutions, characterized by a high thermal resistance, and dedicated particularly for vacuum transfer lines with high temperature difference.},

abstract = {This paper presents critical factors that influence the onset of local buckling in steel beams when exposed to fire conditions. A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model, capable of accounting for critical factors that influence local instability in fire exposed steel beams is developed. This model is applied to investigate the effect of beam-slab interaction, strength properties (Grade) of steel, and presence of fire insulation on the onset of local instability, and resulting capacity degradation in fire exposed steel beams. Results from numerical simulations are utilized to evaluate failure of beams under different limit states including flexure, shear, sectional instability and deflection. These results infer that web instability can occur at early stages of fire loading, leading to faster degradation of shear capacity and premature failure of steel beams before attaining flexural capacity. Also, results from the analysis indicate that the contribution of concrete slab to shear capacity can counterbalance the adverse effect of web local instability to a certain degree. Overall, neglecting the effect of fire-induced web local instability can lead to unconservative design in steel beams or girder subjected to high shear loading and/or local instabilities.},

abstract = {The paper presents a strategy to develop a fully transient numerical model of a heat transfer in building, using a transient CFD model of indoor air and a thermal envelope model, running in a co-simulation. The strategy relies on the utilization of RANS with a high-Re turbulence model and a wall function, which enables to use a coarse computational mesh limiting the computational time. Since wall functions give invalid heat transfer coefficients in thermally developing indoor air regions and the exact location of these regions is not known in indoor spaces, a new air-wall heat transfer calibration procedure is adopted in the co-simulation. It is assumed that there is a uniform surface-averaged and time-dependent heat transfer coefficient per surface, extracted from the CFD solution. The calibration procedure is based on the near-wall mesh density adjustment to obtain surface-average heat transfer coefficients close to those calculated from empirical relationships for natural and forced convection. No local heat transfer coefficients are checked and no dimensionless wall distances y+ are monitored during the simulation. Due to the calibration it is ensured that the average air-wall heat transfer rate is accurate despite the use of wall functions. The capabilities of the model developed based on the strategy are presented in the case study: the analysis of the influence of wall thermal capacitance on indoor environment in a single well-ventilated room. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Cold-formed steel (CFS) is increasingly used in building construction in many countries due to its lightweight and fast and easy construction characteristics. However, its fire resistance is not well understood, which may restrict its applications. For fire design purposes, a good knowledge of the elevated temperature mechanical properties of CFS is essential. Although several useful studies have been conducted on the mechanical properties of CFS, the elevated temperature reduction factors vary significantly among them while no predictive equation is available to calculate the proportional limit stress of CFS at elevated temperatures. Moreover, they also show significant variations between the elevated temperature reduction factors of cold-rolled steel sheets and CFS sections. In this research, low and high strength cold-rolled steel sheets and high strength CFS lipped channel sections and floor decks were tested in the temperature range of 20–700 °C under isothermal conditions to determine the reductions in their mechanical properties. Predictive equations given in AS/NZS 4600 for yield strength and Young's modulus were verified, and new predictive equations for ultimate strength, stress at 2{\%} total strain, 0.05{\%} proof stress and proportional limit stress were proposed. Finally, a two-stage stress-strain model was proposed to accurately predict the stress-strain curves of CFS at ambient and elevated temperatures.},

abstract = {In this paper, the authors present experimental observations and results of full scale standard fire tests as well as thermo-mechanical sequentially coupled finite element simulations on partition walls. A procedure for carrying out numerical simulation of the coupled-thermo-mechanical behaviour is proposed. The numerical models presented for predicting behaviour during fires were calibrated and verified by full scale fire testing. The test wall was constructed using steel C-section studs with gypsum boards fixed on both sides. The wall cavity was filled with Rockwool insulation. The partition wall was tested during exposure to the standard fire test. The thermo-mechanical behaviour of the wall was found to be heavily coupled and influenced by the physical and chemical changes in all constituents of the wall during exposure to fire. The sequentially coupled mechanical response simulation included geometric and material non-linearity as a function of temperature. In spite of the complexity of the fire effects and the strongly coupled thermo- mechanical behaviour, the results of the computational model practically agree with the full scale experimental results. The numerical prediction of the maximum thermal bowing of the wall was found to be very similar to the maximum values measured during the fire test. This has practical implications for assessing the integrity such wall assemblies during exposure to elevated temperatures. The proposed procedure can be used by fire structural engineers and fire testing laboratories as a tool to assist technical assessment exercises. In addition, the proposed procedure can be used during the developmental and modification stages of building components to optimise performance during fire. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Light gauge steel frame (LSF) walls are commonly used in single and two storey residential and commercial buildings and modular based mid-rise building construction. They are lined with single or two layers of gypsum plasterboards and used with or without cavity insulation or noggings. This paper presents the details of a series of standard fire tests of load bearing LSF walls used in low-rise building construction to investigate the effects of using low strength steel studs, noggings and cavity insulation. The presence of cavity insulation significantly reduced the fire resistance level (FRL) of load bearing walls while the use of noggings increased the FRL, and these findings are considered valid for both low and high strength steel stud walls. Structural finite element models of fire tested walls were then developed using appropriate elevated temperature mechanical properties, validated using the fire test results and used in a parametric study of LSF walls made of both low and high strength steel studs. The results showed that FRL of low strength steel stud walls is reduced by about 25{\%} in the common load ratio range in comparison with high strength steel stud walls, while their critical hot flange temperatures are reduced. These differences are due to the variations in their elevated temperature mechanical properties caused by the material composition. Reliable fire performance results of both low and high strength steel stud walls from finite element analyses and fire tests are presented and compared in this paper. This study has highlighted the importance of using accurate elevated temperature mechanical property reduction factors in numerical analyses and design of LSF walls.},

The proposed nonlinear coupled thermo-mechanical approach, accounting for geometry, material and contact nonlinearities, is validated against full-scale furnace test results of typical, commercially available, load-bearing drywall systems, achieving a very good qualitative and quantitative agreement; maximum discrepancies between the predicted and measured fire-resistance ratings do not exceed 2{\%}. Several parametric studies are carried out, concerning the magnitude of the imposed load on the bearing walls and the effect of the cavity insulation placement on the overall fire performance of drywall systems. It is found that installation of thermal insulation inside the drywall cavity may decrease the system's fire-resistance rating, depending on the employed configuration. The proposed numerical approach can be effectively used to estimate the fire-resistance rating of load-bearing lightweight steel drywall systems in support of performance-based fire design standards.},

@article{Gunalan2011a,
abstract = {In recent times, light gauge steel framed (LSF) structures, such as cold-formed steel wall systems, are increasingly used, but without a full understanding of their fire performance. Traditionally the fire resistance rating of these load-bearing LSF wall systems is based on approximate prescriptive methods developed based on limited fire tests. Very often they are limited to standard wall configurations used by the industry. Increased fire rating is provided simply by adding more plasterboards to these walls. This is not an acceptable situation as it not only inhibits innovation and structural and cost efficiencies but also casts doubt over the fire safety of these wall systems. Hence a detailed fire research study into the performance of LSF wall systems was undertaken using full scale fire tests and extensive numerical studies. A new composite wall panel developed at QUT was also considered in this study, where the insulation was used externally between the plasterboards on both sides of the steel wall frame instead of locating it in the cavity. Three full scale fire tests of LSF wall systems built using the new composite panel system were undertaken at a higher load ratio using a gas furnace designed to deliver heat in accordance with the standard time temperature curve in AS 1530.4 (SA, 2005). Fire tests included the measurements of load-deformation characteristics of LSF walls until failure as well as associated time-temperature measurements across the thickness and along the length of all the specimens. Tests of LSF walls under axial compression load have shown the improvement to their fire performance and fire resistance rating when the new composite panel was used. Hence this research recommends the use of the new composite panel system for cold-formed LSF walls. The numerical study was undertaken using a finite element program ABAQUS. The finite element analyses were conducted under both steady state and transient state conditions using the measured hot and cold flange temperature distributions from the fire tests. The elevated temperature reduction factors for mechanical properties were based on the equations proposed by Dolamune Kankanamge and Mahendran (2011). These finite element models were first validated by comparing their results with experimental test results from this study and Kolarkar (2010). The developed finite element models were able to predict the failure times within 5 minutes. The validated model was then used in a detailed numerical study into the strength of cold-formed thin-walled steel channels used in both the conventional and the new composite panel systems to increase the understanding of their behaviour under nonuniform elevated temperature conditions and to develop fire design rules. The measured time-temperature distributions obtained from the fire tests were used. Since the fire tests showed that the plasterboards provided sufficient lateral restraint until the failure of LSF wall panels, this assumption was also used in the analyses and was further validated by comparison with experimental results. Hence in this study of LSF wall studs, only the flexural buckling about the major axis and local buckling were considered. A new fire design method was proposed using AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005), NAS (AISI, 2007) and Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 (ECS, 2006). The importance of considering thermal bowing, magnified thermal bowing and neutral axis shift in the fire design was also investigated. A spread sheet based design tool was developed based on the above design codes to predict the failure load ratio versus time and temperature for varying LSF wall configurations including insulations. Idealised time-temperature profiles were developed based on the measured temperature values of the studs. This was used in a detailed numerical study to fully understand the structural behaviour of LSF wall panels. Appropriate equations were proposed to find the critical temperatures for different composite panels, varying in steel thickness, steel grade and screw spacing for any load ratio. Hence useful and simple design rules were proposed based on the current cold-formed steel structures and fire design standards, and their accuracy and advantages were discussed. The results were also used to validate the fire design rules developed based on AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) and Eurocode Part 1.3 (ECS, 2006). This demonstrated the significant improvements to the design method when compared to the currently used prescriptive design methods for LSF wall systems under fire conditions. In summary, this research has developed comprehensive experimental and numerical thermal and structural performance data for both the conventional and the proposed new load bearing LSF wall systems under standard fire conditions. Finite element models were developed to predict the failure times of LSF walls accurately. Idealized hot flange temperature profiles were developed for non-insulated, cavity and externally insulated load bearing wall systems. Suitable fire design rules and spread sheet based design tools were developed based on the existing standards to predict the ultimate failure load, failure times and failure temperatures of LSF wall studs. Simplified equations were proposed to find the critical temperatures for varying wall panel configurations and load ratios. The results from this research are useful to both structural and fire engineers and researchers. Most importantly, this research has significantly improved the knowledge and understanding of cold-formed LSF loadbearing walls under standard fire conditions.},

abstract = {In order to improve the fire performance of load-bearing CFS wall systems for applications in mid-rise buildings, different panels and external insulation were examined in this paper. Experiments on six full-scale CFS wall specimens were performed in which the insulation material of aluminum silicate wool was located outside the CFS frame and sandwiched between two layers of boards on the fire side instead of being placed in the cavity. Five types of panels were involved in the experiments, including gypsum plasterboard, bolivian magnesium board, oriented standard boards (OSB), autoclaved lightweight concrete (ALC) boards and rock wool boards. The results showed a noticeable reduction of heat transfer to the surface of steel stud and a considerable improvement of fire performance of CFS walls by using aluminum silicate wool as external insulation. For CFS walls with aluminum silicate wool as external insulation on fire side, gypsum plasterboard as face layer and bolivian magnesium board as base layer on both sides, different load ratios may result in different failure modes, and the fire resistant time can be more than 150 min when the load ratio was less than 0.65. It was also demonstrated that the fire performance of CFS wall systems lined with bolivian magnesium board or ALC boards were superior to those lined with gypsum plasterboard and OSB. Therefore, bolivian magnesium board may be recommended to replace gypsum plasterboards as the base layer and ALC board may be used to replace OSB as exterior wall panels of CFS wall systems for applications in mid-rise buildings.},

Improvements have been made with respect to fire, wind/seismic and energy performance of LSF walls with the use of improved stud sections, wall configurations, different sheathing members, and insulation materials. Although the provision of sheet steel as sheathing has been found to improve the in-plane shear capacity of LSF walls, its effects on the fire performance of load bearing walls remain unknown. Three full-scale ISO 834 standard fire tests were conducted in this study to investigate the fire performance of axially loaded gypsum plasterboard and steel sheathed LSF walls made with web-stiffened studs. The results revealed that compared to the commonly used lipped channel stud, the web-stiffened stud is capable of withstanding a 57{\%} greater axial compression load, yet yield the same fire resistance level (FRL), when sheathed only with two layers of gypsum plasterboard. Under the selected load ratio, the addition of steel sheathing caused only marginal improvements in the stud temperature development, resulting in minor improvements to the FRL of load bearing walls. However, the axial load bearing capacity improvement caused by the inclusion of steel sheathing allowed the web-stiffened stud to withstand a 10{\%} greater axial compression load compared to the plasterboard only wall.},

abstract = {This paper presents the mechanical properties of the corner parts of cold-formed steel sections at elevated temperatures. Light-gauge structural members are cold-formed which results the mechanical properties of the corner parts being different from the flat parts. However, previous research has focused on the investigation of the corner parts of cold-formed steel sections at normal room temperature and the performance of the corner parts at elevated temperatures is unknown. An appropriate model for fire resistant design of steel structures necessitates a correct representation of mechanical properties of structural steel at elevated temperatures. Therefore, experimental investigation on corner coupon specimens at different temperatures ranged from approximately 20 to 1000 °C was conducted to study the behaviour of the corner parts of cold-formed steel sections at elevated temperatures. Two kinds of corner coupon specimens, namely the inner corner coupon specimens and outer corner coupon specimens having the steel grade of G500 (nominal 0.2{\%} proof stress of 500 MPa) and nominal thickness of 1.9 mm were tested. The test results were compared with the flat coupon specimens taken from the same cold-formed steel sections as the corner coupon specimens. A unified equation to predict the yield strength (0.2{\%} proof stress), elastic modulus, ultimate strength and ultimate strain of the corner parts of cold-formed steel sections at elevated temperatures is thus proposed in this paper. Generally, it is shown that the proposed equation adequately predicts the test results of the corner coupon specimens. Furthermore, stress–strain curves at different temperatures are plotted and a stress–strain model is also proposed for the corner parts of cold-formed steel sections.},

abstract = {The accuracy of structural fire design of cold-formed steel structures depends on the available predictive models regarding mechanical and thermal properties. The deterioration of mechanical properties, such as yield strength and modulus of elasticity, and the evolution of thermal properties, such as thermal conductivity, thermal elongation and specific heat, with temperature is a key issue in the assessment of the performance of cold-formed steel structural elements in fire. An experimental campaign was undertaken to determine both mechanical and thermal properties of the S280GD+Z steel used in cold-formed steel building construction industry. Tensile coupon tests were carried out to determine the mechanical properties of the S280 GD+Z steel with 2.5 mm thickness at temperatures ranging from 20 to 800 °C. Thermal properties were assessed using the Transient Plane Source (TPS) equipment. Test results were compared with current design standards and with the ones available in the literature. The proposed predictive equations based on the Ramberg–Osgood model show very good agreement with the experimental results for temperatures beyond 300 °C. It was found that some predictive models presented in the EN 1993-1-2:2005 regarding mechanical and thermal properties should be improved. Hence new proposals are presented for both thermal and mechanical properties. Also a modified stress–strain model based on the EN 1993-1-2:2005 formulation is proposed for the S280GD+Z steel.},

abstract = {Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) walls are commonly used in building construction. In general, they are lined with single or double layers of gypsum plasterboards with and without cavity insulation. Gypsum plasterboards act as a thermal barrier to protect the thin-walled steel studs from rapid temperature rise. In these walls, plasterboard joints are located along the studs for ease of construction and are protected by filler materials. During fires, these plasterboard joints crack and open up, and thus allow the stud temperatures to rise rapidly and initiate premature structural failures in LSF walls. This research investigated the detrimental effects of these plasterboards joints on the fire resistance rating of single and double plasterboard lined walls based on the hot flange time-temperature profiles of studs from full scale fire tests. To overcome the detrimental effects of plasterboard joints, the back-blocking technique was used, where plasterboard joints were placed between studs with 150mm wide plasterboards as back-blocks. Full scale fire tests and numerical studies were performed on single plasterboard lined load bearing LSF wall panels to investigate the improved fire performance by using this technique. They showed that the fire resistance rating of these LSF walls was increased by 25{\%} in comparison to the conventional plasterboard joint arrangement over the studs. This paper presents the details of this research on the detrimental effects of plasterboard joints on the fire resistance of load bearing LSF walls, and the results. It also includes a discussion and results for non-load bearing LSF walls.},

abstract = {To design a steel structure in fire is necessary to know its temperature. Using the data from many experimental fire tests, Margaret Law estimated the maximum temperature in a compartment (natural fire), the external heat transfer to steel elements and the maximum temperature value for steel. The Eurocode adopted her method, with minor adjustments. The method is very calculation intensive—it involves about 60 equations—too many for a quick hand calculation. Besides, while a distinction is made between steel members engulfed and not engulfed in flame, the method is not clear about partially engulfed members. The authors developed the software ExteelFire to determine the maximum temperature of external steel structures for buildings in fire based on the Eurocode method including the determination of the temperature of the partially engulfed elements. Aiming to ascertain the level of safety of the Eurocode method, the results from ExteelFire and a numerical analysis performed using Smartfire (CFD software for the fire model) and Super Tempcalc (finite element method, FEM, software for the thermal analysis) were compared. Furthermore, results from ExteelFire and from two full-scale experimental tests (Dalmarnock and Ostrava) were contrasted. Based on the comparisons, the Eurocode method is conservative.

The test apparatus used were a movable radiant panel system, a mid-scale furnace (1.5 m3) and a large-scale furnace (15 m3). The results show that reduced-scale tests are capable of reproducing the heat transferred through the construction at large scale provided there is limited mechanical degradation. The results indicate that the availability of oxygen is fundamental to the fire behaviour of the sandwich composites tested. Reactions occurring in stone wool micro-scale testing, such as oxidative combustion of the binder or crystallisation of the fibres, have a limited effect on the temperature increase when wool is protected from air entrainment.},

abstract = {A self-supporting sandwich panel fa{\c{c}}ade system under fire is studied. First, a thermomechanical FE model, which comprises the complete fa{\c{c}}ade system, and incorporates material degradation and geometrical nonlinear behaviour except for the insulation material and connections, is loaded by a fire temperature curve. Eurocode design rules then predict the screw connections of a sandwich panel will fail in shear. Secondly, an existing programme, FDS-2-Abaqus, is extended to allow its two-way coupled analyses, in which CFD fire simulations are updated for changes in the thermomechanical FE model, to be applicable to the fa{\c{c}}ade system. Again, these simulations show the shear failure of the screws. Parameter studies show differences in system behaviour for improved screw properties; a fuel-controlled vs. ventilation-controlled fire; and different panel thicknesses. Interestingly, as thermal bowing of the panel retards screw failure, and thicker sandwich panels bow less than thinner panels, thicker fa{\c{c}}ade panels will decrease failure time. This and other insights obtained, and the predicted failure of two tiny but critical screws within 80 s, as compared to 150 min lasting sandwich panels in standard fire tests, stresses the need to study complete systems under realistic fires, rather than to study individual components in standard fire tests. Future research will focus on detailed FE models of the connections; full-scale fire experiments; CFD temperature measurement points at the fa{\c{c}}ade outside; detailed modelling of the insulation; and the effects of high temperature creep.},

abstract = {Purpose: This paper presents an investigation conducted to evaluate the effects of important parameters affecting the structural fire performance of LSF walls. It also evaluates the applicability of commonly used critical hot flange temperature method to determine the Fire Resistance Ratings (FRR) of different LSF walls. Design/methodology/approach: The effects of important parameters such as stud section profiles and their dimensions, elevated temperature mechanical property reduction factors of the steel used, types of wall configurations and fire curves on the FRR of LSF walls were investigated. An extensive finite element analysis based parametric study was conducted to evaluate their effects. For this purpose, finite element models which were validated using the full scale fire test results were used. Using the structural capacities obtained from finite element analyses, the load ratio versus FRR curves were produced for all the different LSF walls considered. Findings: Stud depth and thickness significantly affected the fire performance of LSF walls due to the differences in temperature development pattern, thermal bowing deflections and the failure modes of stud. The FRR of LSF walls increased significantly when steel studs with higher elevated temperature mechanical property reduction factors were used. FRR significantly changed when realistic design fire curves were used instead of the standard fire curve. Furthermore, both the critical hot and average flange temperature methods were found to be unsuitable to predict the FRR of LSF walls. Originality/value: The developed comprehensive fire performance data would facilitate the development of LSF walls with enhanced fire performance and importantly it would facilitate and advance the successful applications of HFC section studs in LSF walls.},

abstract = {Cold-formed Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems are increasingly used in low-rise and multi-storey buildings and hence their fire safety has become important in the design of buildings. A composite LSF wall panel system was developed recently, where a thin insulation was sandwiched between two plasterboards to improve the fire performance of LSF walls. Many experimental and numerical studies have been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of non-load bearing LSF wall under standard conditions. However, only limited research has been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of load bearing LSF walls under standard and realistic design fire conditions. Therefore in this research, finite element thermal models of both the conventional load bearing LSF wall panels with cavity insulation and the innovative LSF composite wall panel were developed to simulate their thermal behaviour under standard and realistic design fire conditions. Suitable thermal properties were proposed for plasterboards and insulations based on laboratory tests and available literature. The developed models were then validated by comparing their results with available fire test results of load bearing LSF wall. This paper presents the details of the developed finite element models of load bearing LSF wall panels and the thermal analysis results. It shows that finite element models can be used to simulate the thermal behaviour of load bearing LSF walls with varying configurations of insulations and plasterboards. Failure times of load bearing LSF walls were also predicted based on the results from finite element thermal analyses. Finite element analysis results show that the use of cavity insulation was detrimental to the fire rating of LSF walls while the use of external insulation offered superior thermal protection to them. Effects of realistic design fire conditions are also presented in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2014 Journal of Structural Fire Engineering. All Rights Reserved.},

In this study, the validated finite element models of LSF wall panels subject to standard fire conditions were used in a detailed parametric study to investigate the effects of important parameters such as steel grade and thickness, plasterboard screw spacing, plasterboard lateral restraint, insulation materials and load ratio on their performance under standard fire conditions. Suitable equations were proposed to predict the time-temperature profiles of LSF wall studs with eight different plasterboard-insulation configurations, and used in the finite element analyses. Finite element parametric studies produced extensive fire performance data for the LSF wall panels in the form of load ratio versus time and critical hot flange (failure) temperature curves for eight wall configurations. This data demonstrated the superior fire performance of externally insulated LSF wall panels made of different steel grades and thicknesses. It also led to the development of a set of equations to predict the important relationship between the load ratio and the critical hot flange temperature of LSF wall studs. Finally this paper proposes a simplified method to predict the fire resistance rating of LSF walls based on the two proposed set of equations for the load ratio-hot flange temperature and the time-temperature relationships. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In recent times, fire has become a major disaster in buildings due to the increase in fire loads, as a result of modern furniture and light weight construction. This has caused problems for safe evacuation and rescue activities, and in some instances lead to the collapse of buildings (Lewis, 2008 and Nyman, 2002). Recent research has shown that the actual fire resistance of building elements exposed to building fires can be less than their specified fire resistance rating (Lennon and Moore, 2003, Jones, 2002, Nyman, 2002 and Abecassis-Empis et al. 2008). Conventionally the fire rating of building elements is determined using fire tests based on the standard fire time-temperature curve given in ISO 834. This ISO 834 curve was developed in the early 1900s, where wood was the basic fuel source. In reality, modern buildings make use of thermoplastic materials, synthetic foams and fabrics. These materials are high in calorific values and increase both the speed of fire growth and heat release rate, thus increasing the fire severity beyond that of the standard fire curve. Hence it suggests the need to use realistic fire time-temperature curves in tests. Real building fire temperature profiles depend on the fuel load representing the combustible building contents, ventilation openings and thermal properties of wall lining materials. Fuel load is selected based on a review and suitable realistic fire time-temperature curves were developed. Fire tests were then performed for plasterboard lined light gauge steel framed walls for the developed realistic fire curves. This paper presents the details of the development of suitable realistic building fire curves, and the fire tests using them. It describes the fire performance of tested walls in comparison to the standard fire tests and highlights the differences between them. This research has shown the need to use realistic fire exposures in assessing the fire resistance rating of building elements.},

abstract = {To study the shear performance of the new connector used in the CFS frame shear wall with steel sheathing and gypsum board, an experiment subject to monotonic loading and a finite element simulation of screw connectors were carried out. The following results were obtained. (a) The failure modes of the screw connectors underwent ductile failure caused by pressure deformation and tearing failure of the sheathing panels, and a few specimens experienced brittle failure caused by shearing-off of self-drilling screws. (b) The increase in the end distance or edge distance has less influence on the shear resistance of the screw connectors if either of them exceeds 15 mm. Besides, the increase in spacing of screws has less effect on the shear resistance of the screw connectors if the spacing of screws exceeds 100 mm. The thickness of the gypsum board did not have a distinct effect on the shear resistance of screw connectors. The diameter of the screws, thickness of the steel sheets and thickness of the studs had a significant effect on the shear resistance of screw connectors. (c) Two kinds of failure modes existed for the screw connectors obtained by the finite element simulation, namely, the shearing failure and the combination failure of bearing and tilting. The simulated failure modes were consistent with the experimental results, and the simulated load-displacement curves were close to the experimental results, which indicated the effectiveness of the finite element simulation method.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel members have been widely used in residential, industrial and commercial buildings as primary load-bearing and non-load bearing structural elements. These buildings must be properly evaluated after a fire event to assess the nature and extent of structural damage. If the general appearance of the structure is satisfactory after a fire event then the question that has to be answered is how the structural capacity of cold-formed steel members in these buildings has been affected. Elevated temperatures during a fire event affect the structural performance of cold-formed steel members even after cooling down to ambient temperature due to the possible detrimental changes in their mechanical properties. However, the post-fire behaviour of cold-formed steel members has not been investigated in the past and hence there is a need to investigate the post-fire mechanical properties of cold-formed steels. Therefore an experimental study was undertaken at the Queensland University of Technology to understand the residual mechanical properties of cold-formed steels after fire events. Tensile coupon tests were conducted on three different steel grades and thicknesses to obtain their stress-strain curves and relevant mechanical properties after cooling them down from different elevated temperatures. It was found that the post-fire mechanical properties of cold-formed steels are different to the original ambient temperature mechanical properties. Hence a new set of equations is proposed to predict the reduced mechanical properties of cold-formed steels after a fire event.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel sections are commonly used in low-rise commercial and residential buildings. During fire events, cold-formed steel structural elements in these buildings are exposed to elevated temperatures. Hence after such events there is a need to determine the residual strength of these structural elements. However, only limited information is available in relation to the residual strength of fire exposed cold-formed steel members. This research is aimed at investigating the residual distortional buckling capacities of fire exposed cold-formed steel lipped channel sections. A series of compression tests of fire exposed, short lipped channel columns made of varying steel grades and thicknesses was undertaken in this research. Test columns were exposed to different elevated temperatures up to 800 °C. They were then allowed to cool down at ambient temperature before they were tested to failure. Suitable finite element models of tested columns were also developed and validated using test results. The residual compression capacities of tested columns were predicted using the ambient temperature cold-formed steel design rules (AS/NZS 4600, AISI S100 and Direct Strength Method). Post-fire mechanical properties obtained from a previous study were used in this study. Comparison of results showed that ambient temperature design rules for compression members can be used to predict the residual compression capacities of fire exposed short or laterally restrained cold-formed steel columns provided the maximum temperature experienced by the columns can be estimated after a fire event. Such residual capacity assessments will allow structural and fire engineers to make an accurate prediction of the safety of buildings after fire events. This paper presents the details of these experimental and numerical studies and the results.},

abstract = {Fire performance of plasterboard lined Light-gauge Steel Framed (LSF) walls has been investigated using numerical and experimental studies in the past. However, past research has been limited to lipped channel sections (LCS) and welded hollow flange channel (HFC) sections. This paper investigates the fire performance of LSF walls made of a new web-Stiffened Channel Section (SCS) stud using numerical models, validated using available fire test results. The SCS succeeds in eliminating both local and distortional buckling when used as 3 m long LSF wall studs at ambient temperature. Ambient temperature compression capacity evaluations showed that the performance of the SCS is equivalent to the welded HFC, but is superior to the LCS. Fire performance of load bearing and non-load bearing LSF walls made with each of the three stud sections was assessed for three common wall configurations using thermal and structural finite element analyses. Extended FRL versus Load Ratio curves were developed using a combination of steady state and transient state coupled temperature-displacement analyses. The results showed that the effect of stud geometry on the fire performance of LSF wall configurations is minimal. Under the same load ratio, all three stud sections perform similarly in each of the wall configurations. Considering the ambient and fire performance results, the reduced cost and also the potential double connectivity to plasterboard via its lip elements, the SCS is recommended for use in LSF walls. This paper has also highlighted the susceptibility of non-load bearing LSF walls to fail in fire under structural inadequacy.},

abstract = {This dissertation explores the link between civil-military relations and international conflict. In particular, I ask whether strategies that leaders invoke to protect themselves from their own militaries might under some conditions increase the risk of war. Even though civil-military relations is fundamental to state-building, and despite the sizable literature on domestic causes of international conflict, there is very little work on the international implications of regimes' efforts to protect themselves from their own militaries. My argument is that when coups are possible, usually leaders divide their armed forces into rival organizations that they intend to check and balance each other and protect the regime as a by-product of mutual suspicion. (I label this strategy counterbalancing). Counterbalancing depends on leaders' ability to keep their own armed forces apart by promoting conflict among them. But military elites may rebel if they come to understand how leaders profit from inter-organizational hostility. Hence, counterbalancing requires leaders to conceal control benefits they accrue when they induce their own forces to compete. Because international conflict conceals these benefits, leaders may invent enemies, prepare for war, and engage in low-level international disputes when their foundational objective is to use counterbalancing to subordinate their own militaries. Contrary to the sizable literature on scapegoating, my argument is that in the realm of civil-military relations regimes may use provocative foreign policy to reinforce institutional divisions rather than to achieve cohesion. The argument is tested via a multi-method strategy that includes a pooled, time-series analysis of almost every country in the world over the last two decades of the Cold War as well as historical case studies of civil-military relations in Syria in the early 1970's and Georgia in the mid-1990's.},

A composite LSF wall panel system was developed recently, where a thin insulation was sandwiched between two plasterboards to improve the fire performance of LSF walls. Many experimental and numerical studies have been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of non-load bearing LSF wall under standard conditions. However, only limited research has been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of load bearing LSF walls under standard and realistic design fire conditions. Therefore in this research, finite element thermal models of both the conventional load bearing LSF wall panels with cavity insulation and the innovative LSF composite wall panel were developed to simulate their thermal behaviour under standard and realistic design fire conditions. Suitable thermal properties were proposed for plasterboards and insulations based on laboratory tests and available literature. The developed models were then validated by comparing their results with available fire test results of load bearing LSF wall. This paper presents the details of the developed finite element models of load bearing LSF wall panels and the thermal analysis results. It shows that finite element models can be used to simulate the thermal behaviour of load bearing LSF walls with varying configurations of insulations and plasterboards. Failure times of load bearing LSF walls were also predicted based on the results from finite element thermal analyses. Finite element analysis results show that the use of cavity insulation was detrimental to the fire rating of LSF walls while the use of external insulation offered superior thermal protection to them. Effects of realistic design fire conditions are also presented in this paper.},

However, these thin-walled steel sections heat up quickly and lose their strength under fire conditions despite the protection provided by plasterboards. A new composite wall panel was recently proposed to improve the fire resistance rating of LSF walls, where an insulation layer was used externally between the plasterboards on both sides of the wall frame instead of using it in the cavity. A research study using both fire tests and numerical studies was undertaken to investigate the structural and thermal behaviour of load bearing LSF walls made of both conventional and the new composite panels under standard fire conditions and to determine their fire resistance rating. This paper presents the details of finite element models of LSF wall studs developed to simulate the structural performance of LSF wall panels under standard fire conditions. Finite element analyses were conducted under both steady and transient state conditions using the time-temperature profiles measured during the fire tests. The developed models were validated using the fire test results of 11 LSF wall panels with various plasterboard/insulation configurations and load ratios. They were able to predict the fire resistance rating within 5. min. The use of accurate numerical models allowed the inclusion of various complex structural and thermal effects such as local buckling, thermal bowing and neutral axis shift that occurred in thin-walled steel studs under non-uniform elevated temperature conditions. Finite element analyses also demonstrated the improvements offered by the new composite panel system over the conventional cavity insulated system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Twenty-four 1200×1200×6 mm3 soda-lime glass panes in eight different fixing forms were heated by a 500×500 mm2 N-heptane pool fire to investigate the influence of fixing conditions on glass breakage and fallout. The time of crack initiation, behavior of crack propagation, heat release rates, central gas temperatures, glass surface temperatures and loss of integrity of the glazing assembly were investigated. The relationship between fixing form and crack behavior is discussed, based on the experimental results. The results show that all the cracks initiated at the supporting point and intersected rapidly, causing glass fallout. Mechanical stress caused by supporting pins and thermal stress caused by glass temperature difference (ranging from 48 °C to 159 °C) are the causes of breaking for this kind of curtain wall. It is concluded that various fixing locations have a significant effect on glass breaking. Among the eight cases, the glass panes whose supporting points were located at 10 cm (Case 1) or 5 cm (Case 8) from the edges performed best: these support locations are recommended in practical engineering because of the good fire resistance and structural beauty of such panes.},

Secondly, an existing programme, FDS-2-Abaqus, is extended to allow its two-way coupled analyses, in which CFD fire simulations are updated for changes in the thermomechanical FE model, to be applicable to the fa{\c{c}}ade system. Again, these simulations show the shear failure of the screws. Parameter studies show differences in system behaviour for improved screw properties; a fuel-controlled vs. ventilation-controlled fire; and different panel thicknesses. Interestingly, as thermal bowing of the panel retards screw failure, and thicker sandwich panels bow less than thinner panels, thicker fa{\c{c}}ade panels will decrease failure time. This and other insights obtained, and the predicted failure of two tiny but critical screws within 80 s, as compared to 150 min lasting sandwich panels in standard fire tests, stresses the need to study complete systems under realistic fires, rather than to study individual components in standard fire tests. Future research will focus on detailed FE models of the connections; full-scale fire experiments; CFD temperature measurement points at the fa{\c{c}}ade outside; detailed modelling of the insulation; and the effects of high temperature creep.},

abstract = {The concept of cold-formed light steel framing construction has been widespread after understanding its structural characteristics with massive research works over the years. Connection serves as one of the important elements for light steel framing in order to achieve its structural stability. Compared to hot-rolled steel sections, cold-formed steel connections perform dissimilarity due to the thin-walled behaviour. This paper aims to review current researches on cold-formed steel connections, particularly for screw connections, storage rack connections, welded connections, and bolted connections. The performance of these connections in the design of cold-formed steel structures is discussed.},

abstract = {Gypsum plasterboard is a common lining material used in cold-formed steel wall frame systems. It is used either with lipped or unlipped (plain) C-section studs in the construction of both the load bearing and non-load bearing walls in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. The design of these wall frames does not utilise the full strengthening effects of the plasterboard in carrying the axial loads. An experimental study has shown that the strength of the studs in compression was increased significantly when they were lined with plasterboard on one or both sides. In order to fully understand the behaviour of both sides lined steel wall frames, a finite element model was developed and validated using experimental results. This was followed by a detailed parametric study using finite element analyses. This paper presents the details of the finite element modelling of both sides lined wall frames and the results. A design method based on appropriate effective length factors was developed within the provisions of Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures to predict the ultimate loads and failure modes of both sides lined steel wall frames. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Light gauge steel-framed (LSF) walls, commonly made with lipped channel studs and gypsum plasterboard sheathing, are increasingly being used in low to mid-rise buildings. Improvements have been made with respect to fire, wind/seismic and energy performance of LSF walls with the use of improved stud sections, wall configurations, different sheathing members, and insulation materials. Although the provision of sheet steel as sheathing has been found to improve the in-plane shear capacity of LSF walls, its effects on the fire performance of load bearing walls remain unknown. Three full-scale ISO 834 standard fire tests were conducted in this study to investigate the fire performance of axially loaded gypsum plasterboard and steel sheathed LSF walls made with web-stiffened studs. The results revealed that compared to the commonly used lipped channel stud, the web-stiffened stud is capable of withstanding a 57{\%} greater axial compression load, yet yield the same fire resistance level (FRL), when sheathed only with two layers of gypsum plasterboard. Under the selected load ratio, the addition of steel sheathing caused only marginal improvements in the stud temperature development, resulting in minor improvements to the FRL of load bearing walls. However, the axial load bearing capacity improvement caused by the inclusion of steel sheathing allowed the web-stiffened stud to withstand a 10{\%} greater axial compression load compared to the plasterboard only wall.},

The work involves three phases, namely heat transfer analysis, pre-buckling analysis and buckling analysis. The heat transfer analysis is accomplished using two-dimensional finite element analysis methods, from which the temperature fields of the channel-section beams are obtained. The pre-buckling analysis is completed using the Bernoulli bending theory of beams with considering the effects of temperature on strain and mechanical properties. The buckling analysis is performed using combined finite strip analysis and classical Fourier series solutions, in which the mechanical properties are considered to be temperature dependent. The results show that there are significant temperature variations in web, fire exposed flange and lip. Also, it is found that the buckling behaviour of the beam with temperature variation in its section is quite different from that of the beam with a constant uniform temperature in its section.},

abstract = {The post-fire performance of concrete-filled stainless steel tubular (CFSST) columns subjected to an entire loading–fire history, including four characteristic phases: (i) ambient temperature loading, (ii) heating, (iii) cooling with constant external loads, and (iv) post-fire loading, is investigated in this paper. Sequentially coupled thermal-stress analyses are performed using ABAQUS to establish the temperature field and structural response of CFSST columns. To improve the precision of the finite element analysis (FEA) models, the influence of moisture on the thermal conductivity and specific heat of the concrete in the heating and cooling phases is considered by using subroutines. Existing fire and post-fire test data on CFSST columns are used to validate the FEA modelling. Comparisons between FEA and test results indicate that the accuracy of the model is acceptable; the FEA model is then extended to simulate CFSST columns subjected to the four characteristic phases. The behaviour of the CFSST columns during the four characteristic phases is explained by analysis of the temperature distribution, load versus axial deformation relations, failure modes and internal force redistribution. The excellent post-fire performance of CFSST columns is examined in comparison with traditional concrete-filled carbon steel tubular (CFST) columns with the same total cross-sectional area. The residual strength index is studied with respect to a series of parametric analyses. It is found that the residual strength of CFSST columns is higher than that of CFST columns after the same fire exposure, and that the diameter of the stainless steel tube, slenderness, heating time ratio and load ratio have a significant influence on the residual strength index.},

abstract = {A model is presented that describes the heat transfer through a gypsum wallboard partition assembly incorporating the mass transport effects of water in liquid and vapor form. Sources of water include surface bound (adsorbed) water and hydrated water that is chemically bound with the crystal matrix of gypsum. Liberated water is allowed to migrate through the porous structure through molecular diffusion and pressure driven flow. Evaporation or condensation occurs when the partial pressure of water vapor with the pore space is less than or greater than the saturation pressure, respectively. Results obtained from the model are compared to measurements taken during a standard fire resistance test. It is found that the surface temperatures are typically under-predicted, although qualitatively similar behavior is observed. The analysis implies that the liberation and transport of water in both its liquid and vapor form plays a significant role in the thermal response of gypsum wallboard subjected to fire exposures, perhaps even beyond the extent to which the current model has been developed. The model can be used, under the assumptions through which it was developed, to conduct sensitivity studies of the physical parameters and evaluate the effect upon the fire resistance of the system.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel members have been widely used in residential and commercial buildings as primary load bearing structural elements. They are often made of thin steel sheets and hence they are more susceptible to local buckling. The buckling behaviour of cold-formed steel compression members under fire conditions is not fully investigated yet and hence there is a lack of knowledge on the fire performance of cold-formed steel compression members. Current cold-formed steel design standards do not provide adequate design guidelines for the fire design of cold-formed steel compression members. Therefore a research project based on extensive experimental and numerical studies was undertaken to investigate the local buckling behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel compression members under simulated fire conditions. First a series of 91 local buckling tests was conducted at ambient and uniform elevated temperatures up to 700 °C on cold-formed lipped and unlipped channels. Suitable finite element models were then developed to simulate the behaviour of tested columns and were validated using test results. All the ultimate load capacity results for local buckling were compared with the predictions from the available design rules based on AS/NZS 4600, BS 5950 Part 5, Eurocode 3 Parts 1.2 and 1.3 and the direct strength method (DSM), based on which suitable recommendations have been made for the fire design of cold-formed steel compression members subject to local buckling at uniform elevated temperatures.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel members can be assembled in various combinations to provide cost-efficient and safe light gauge floor systems for buildings. Such Light gauge Steel Framing (LSF) systems are widely accepted in industrial and commercial building construction. An example application is in floor-ceiling systems. Light gauge steel floor-ceiling systems must be designed to serve as fire compartment boundaries and provide adequate fire resistance. Fire-rated floor-ceiling assemblies formed with new materials and construction methodologies have been increasingly used in buildings. However, limited research has been undertaken in the past and hence a thorough understanding of their fire resistance behaviour is not available. Recently a new composite floor-ceiling system has been developed to provide higher fire rating under standard fire conditions. But its increased fire rating could not be determined using the currently available design methods. Therefore a research project was carried out to investigate its structural and fire resistance behaviour under standard fire conditions. In this research project full scale experimental tests of the new LSF floor system based on a composite ceiling unit were undertaken using a gas furnace at the Queensland University of Technology. Both the conventional and the new steel floor-ceiling systems were tested under structural and fire loads. Full scale fire tests provided a good understanding of the fire behaviour of the LSF floor-ceiling systems and confirmed the superior performance of the new composite system. This paper presents the details of this research into the structural and fire behaviour of light gauge steel floor systems protected by the new composite panel, and the results.},

Although numerous heat transfer studies have been conducted, literature indicates there are extensive differences in the thermal properties used in these studies. Comprehensive experimental and numerical analyses have been conducted to elucidate the leading factor in the ablation of a gypsum board system when it is exposed to the standard fire resistance test. A methodology based on both simultaneous thermal analysis and computational modelling is proposed to understand the behaviour of a gypsum plasterboard when the boundary temperature increases quickly as one side of the wall is subjected to the standard ISO 834. Finally, four different wall assemblies made of a commercial fireproof plasterboard system are exposed to the standard test.

A three-dimensional Finite Element Method (FEM) model has been developed and calibrated against 12 experiments, comprising of six unrestrained and six axially restrained EHS columns of two slenderness, $\lambda$z=40.1 and $\lambda$z=50.8. The EHS temperature profiles and axial displacements, measured under three different loading levels, ($\alpha$L=0.3, 0.45 and 0.6) were utilised in the calibration process. The mechanical and thermal properties for carbon steel at elevated temperatures, detailed in the Eurocode standard EC3 Part 1–2, design of steel structures [1] have been applied. Axial displacement charts illustrate that a close agreement between the FEM model and the experiment results was achieved, while highlighting how critical the thermal expansion coefficient and geometric imperfection was during the calibration process. Ultimately, the paper will detail appropriate recommendations for the thermal analysis of unfilled Elliptical Hollow Section steel columns, of steel grade S355J2H, and provide the platform for comprehensive parametric fire investigations to commence.},

For this purpose two 12 mm thick gypsum boards are subjected to the standard fire ISO 834 and the temperature distribution within them is measured by means of thermocouples placed at different depths in the samples. The results hereof are used to validate a numerical model based on the density, thermal conductivity, and effective heat capacity of the gypsum board as functions of temperature. The effects of dehydration/calcination and decomposition on these properties are determined by using thermogravimetric analysis, conductivity measurements after different heat treatments, and differential scanning calorimetry under air flow, respectively.},

abstract = {A nonlinear finite element three-dimensional model is presented and validated in this work against standard fire tests. The aim is to develop a numerical tool in order to study the behavior of prestressed Hollow Core (HC) slabs in the event of fire. A sequentially coupled approach is considered in order to perform the thermo-mechanical analysis at an affordable computational cost. The model includes the effect of prestress and a realistic constitutive inelastic behavior of concrete, for both tension and compression. It takes into account the temperature dependency of the material properties, and thus the crack patterns due to bending, shear, thermal cracking and longitudinal cracking are reproduced. The model is validated by comparing the simulation results with 11 real fire resistance tests on single elements, obtaining satisfactory results in terms of both failure mechanism and failure time. Finally, the suitability of using the simple calculation models existing in the European codes (Eurocode 2, EN 1168) for the verification of the HC resistance in fire situation is discussed. In particular, the numerical results are compared to the simple calculation model given in the EN 1168.},

abstract = {Fire safety of buildings has been recognised as very important by the building industry and the community at large. Traditionally, increased fire rating is provided by simply adding more plasterboards to light gauge steel frame (LSF) walls, which is inefficient. Many research studies have been undertaken to investigate the thermal behaviour of traditional LSF stud wall systems under standard fire conditions. However, no research has been undertaken on the thermal behaviour of LSF stud walls using the recently proposed composite panel. Extensive fire testing of both non-load bearing and load bearing wall panels was conducted in this research based on the standard time-temperature curve in AS1530.4. Three groups of LSF wall specimens were tested with no insulation, cavity insulation and the new composite panel based on an external insulation layer between plasterboards. This paper presents the details of this experimental study into the thermal performance of non-load bearing walls lined with various configurations of plasterboard and insulation. Extensive descriptive and numerical results of the tested non-load bearing wall panels given in this paper provide a thorough understanding of their thermal behaviour, and valuable time-temperature data that can be used to validate numerical models. Test results showed that the innovative composite stud wall systems outperformed the traditional stud wall systems in terms of their thermal performance, giving a much higher fire rating.},

abstract = {Structural fire safety has become one of the key considerations in the design and maintenance of the built infrastructure. Conventionally the fire resistance rating of load bearing Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) walls is determined based on the standard timetemperature curve given in ISO 834. Recent research has shown that the true fire resistance of building elements exposed to building fires can be less than their fire resistance ratings determined based on standard fire tests. It is questionable whether the standard timetemperature curve truly represents the fuel loads in modern buildings. Therefore an equivalent fire severity approach has been used in the past to obtain fire resistance rating. This is based on the performance of a structural member exposed to a realistic design fire curve in comparison to that of standard fire time-temperature curve. This paper presents the details of research undertaken to develop an energy based time equivalent approach to obtain the fire resistance ratings of LSF walls exposed to realistic design fire curves with respect to standard fire exposure. This approach relates to the amount of energy transferred to the member. The proposed method was used to predict the fire resistance ratings of single and double layer plasterboard lined and externally insulated LSF walls. The predicted fire ratings were compared with the results from finite element analyses and fire design rules for three different wall configurations exposed to both rapid and prolonged fires. The comparison shows that the proposed energy method can be used to obtain the fire resistance ratings of LSF walls in the case of prolonged fires.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel members are often subject to axial compression loads in a range of applications. These thin-walled members can be subject to various types of buckling modes, including flexural-torsional buckling. Design standards provide guidelines for columns subject to flexural-torsional buckling modes at ambient temperature. However, there are no specific design guidelines for elevated temperature conditions. Hence extensive research efforts have gone into the many investigations addressing the flexural-torsional buckling behaviour of cold-formed steel columns at elevated temperatures.This research has reviewed the accuracy of the current design rules in AS/NZS 4600 and the North American Specification in determining the member capacities of cold-formed steel columns using the results from detailed finite element analyses and an experimental study of lipped channel columns. It was found that the current ambient temperature Australian and American design rules accurately predicted the member capacities of pin ended lipped channel columns undergoing flexural torsional buckling at elevated temperatures by simply using the appropriate elevated temperature mechanical properties. However, for fixed ended columns with warping fixity undergoing flexural-torsional buckling, it was found that the current design rules significantly underestimated the column capacities as they disregard the beneficial effect of warping fixity. This research has therefore proposed improved design rules and verified their accuracy using finite element analysis and test results of cold-formed lipped channel columns made of three cross-sections and five different steel grades and thicknesses. This paper presents the details of this research study and the results.},

abstract = {This paper describes a novel methodology for conducting stable hybrid fire testing (HTF). During hybrid fire testing, only a part of the structure is tested in a furnace while the reminded structure is calculated separately, here by means of a predetermined matrix. Equilibrium and compatibility at the interface between the tested “physical substructure” and the “numerical substructure” is maintained throughout the test using a dedicated algorithm. The procedures developed so far are sensitive to the stiffness ratio between the physical and the numerical substructure and therefore they can be applied only in some cases. In fire field, the stiffness of the heated physical substructure may change dramatically and the resulting change in stiffness ratio can lead to instability during the test. To overcome this drawback, a methodology independent of the stiffness ratio has been developed, inspired from the Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting (FETI) method, which has been originally developed for substructuring in numerical analyses. The novel methodology has been successfully applied to a hybrid fire test in a purely numerical environment, i.e. the physical substructure was also modelled numerically. It is shown that stability does not depend on the stiffness ratio and that equilibrium and compatibility can be consistently maintained at the interface during the fire. Finally, the ongoing experimental program aimed at employing and experimentally validating this methodology is described.},

The vehicle body temperature profile from the heat transfer analysis is applied as an input for a structural analysis to predict buckling. This study is focused on the radiant section of the curing ovens. The radiant section of the oven has the largest temperature gradients within the body structure. This methodology couples a fully transient thermal analysis to simulate the structure through the electro-coat and paint curing environments with a structural, buckling analysis.

abstract = {Prefabricated lightweight aerated concrete (PLAC) panels provide low thermal conductivity, potentially high stiffness-to-weight ratios, cost-effective material and structural systems and rapid modular construction. These panels can be utilised as floor slabs or external walls for various applications in building construction. The fire performance of the PLAC panel is examined in this work for a particular case, namely a prefabricated emergency bushfire shelter, which is one of the key applications of PLAC panels. Since, bushfires have unique heating curves, standardised tests are not useful and the system needs to be tested in a manner such that the heat flux of an actual bush fire can be reproduced. In this study, the fire performance enhancement of dual-skin bushfire bunkers, which are comprised of lightweight concrete and base metal thickness (BMT) steel, are examined experimentally and validated numerically. The Speedpanel PLAC modular panel explored in this work is a lightweight wall system primarily used for acoustic and thermal insulation purposes. Burning experimental studies of a single panel and dual-skin bunkers are carried out on a full scale. The experimental results are compared with fire safety codes for building materials to identify the key areas for improvements. A fire dynamic numerical model has been developed in this work using the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) to simulate the burning process of PLAC structures. Numerical results of heat production are presented in comparison with experimental observations for validating the computational model. The proposed numerical model is used to predict the fire performance of a dual-skin bushfire bunker, demonstrating the need to have at least two PLAC layers to ensure fire safety compliance.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel stud walls are a major component of Light Steel Framing (LSF) building systems used in commercial, industrial and residential buildings. In the conventional LSF stud wall systems, thin steel studs are protected from fire by placing one or two layers of plasterboard on both sides with or without cavity insulation. However, there is very limited data about the structural and thermal performance of stud wall systems while past research showed contradicting results, for example, about the benefits of cavity insulation. This research was therefore conducted to improve the knowledge and understanding of the structural and thermal performance of cold-formed steel stud wall systems (both load bearing and non-load bearing) under fire conditions and to develop new improved stud wall systems including reliable and simple methods to predict their fire resistance rating. Full scale fire tests of cold-formed steel stud wall systems formed the basis of this research. This research proposed an innovative LSF stud wall system in which a composite panel made of two plasterboards with insulation between them was used to improve the fire rating. Hence fire tests included both conventional steel stud walls with and without the use of cavity insulation and the new composite panel system. A propane fired gas furnace was specially designed and constructed first. The furnace was designed to deliver heat in accordance with the standard time temperature curve as proposed by AS 1530.4 (SA, 2005). A compression loading frame capable of loading the individual studs of a full scale steel stud wall system was also designed and built for the load-bearing tests. Fire tests included comprehensive time-temperature measurements across the thickness and along the length of all the specimens using K type thermocouples. They also included the measurements of load-deformation characteristics of stud walls until failure. The first phase of fire tests included 15 small scale fire tests of gypsum plasterboards, and composite panels using different types of insulating material of varying thickness and density. Fire performance of single and multiple layers of gypsum plasterboards was assessed including the effect of interfaces between adjacent plasterboards on the thermal performance. Effects of insulations such as glass fibre, rock fibre and cellulose fibre were also determined while the tests provided important data relating to the temperature at which the fall off of external plasterboards occurred. In the second phase, nine small scale non-load bearing wall specimens were tested to investigate the thermal performance of conventional and innovative steel stud wall systems. Effects of single and multiple layers of plasterboards with and without vertical joints were investigated. The new composite panels were seen to offer greater thermal protection to the studs in comparison to the conventional panels. In the third phase of fire tests, nine full scale load bearing wall specimens were tested to study the thermal and structural performance of the load bearing wall assemblies. A full scale test was also conducted at ambient temperature. These tests showed that the use of cavity insulation led to inferior fire performance of walls, and provided good explanations and supporting research data to overcome the incorrect industry assumptions about cavity insulation. They demonstrated that the use of insulation externally in a composite panel enhanced the thermal and structural performance of stud walls and increased their fire resistance rating significantly. Hence this research recommends the use of the new composite panel system for cold-formed LSF walls. This research also included steady state tensile tests at ambient and elevated temperatures to address the lack of reliable mechanical properties for high grade cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures. Suitable predictive equations were developed for calculating the yield strength and elastic modulus at elevated temperatures. In summary, this research has developed comprehensive experimental thermal and structural performance data for both the conventional and the proposed non-load bearing and load bearing stud wall systems under fire conditions. Idealized hot flange temperature profiles have been developed for non-insulated, cavity insulated and externally insulated load bearing wall models along with suitable equations for predicting their failure times. A graphical method has also been proposed to predict the failure times (fire rating) of non-load bearing and load bearing walls under different load ratios. The results from this research are useful to both fire researchers and engineers working in this field. Most importantly, this research has significantly improved the knowledge and understanding of cold-formed LSF walls under fire conditions, and developed an innovative LSF wall system with increased fire rating. It has clearly demonstrated the detrimental effects of using cavity insulation, and has paved the way for Australian building industries to develop new wall panels with increased fire rating for commercial applications worldwide.},

abstract = {Fire design requires three fire resistance criteria, namely integrity, insulation and load-bearing. In particular, repartition wall systems used in residential and commercial buildings are required to provide certification of insulation and integrity fire resistance and have to be analysed in the context of the characteristic time scales of a fire. This paper presents a numerical methodology to simulate the fire integrity resistance of full-scale timber-based wall systems exposed to fire. The main contribution of this paper, with regard to the existing literature, is the presence of cross-laminated timber (CLT) panel in the central part of the wall system, where the pyrolysis of timber was modelled explicitly in the energy balance equation system. For this end, a user-subroutine, called UMATHT, is developed and successfully implemented in the Abaqus finite element code for thermal analysis. The falling off of the gypsum boards under fire was considered implicitly in the FE model based on experimental observations. The obtained results show clearly the need to take into account explicitly the cracks and falling off of the gypsum boards for an appropriate prediction of the integrity fire resistance in order to reduce expensive experimental procedures.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical and experimental study of double angle members connected by batten plates under concentric and eccentric axial compression. The number of batten plates is varied to study the influence on the nominal axial strength. Numerical analyses are able to accurately predict the behavior and strength found in the experiments, except for long columns under eccentric axial compression where the composite section failed in major-axis flexural buckling. Two design hypotheses are compared to the results obtained: (i) non-composite action (no interaction between angles), with only local, flexural, and flexural-torsional buckling considered; and (ii) composite action (full interaction between angles), and the only considering local and minor-axis flexural buckling of the pair of angles. The two design hypotheses ignore load eccentricity. Numerical and experimental results for angles connected by bolted batten plates fall in between the design curves defined by methods (i) and (ii), while angles connected by welded batten plates have greater strength than the design curve defined by method (ii). The use of batten plates significantly increases the strength of the system, especially for members under eccentric compression. However, the strength remains constant after a certain number of batten plates are connected, and after a minimum batten plate width is reached.},

abstract = {The current design rules on bolted connections of thin sheet steels for cold-formed steel structures are applicable for ambient temperature condition only. Investigation of single shear bolted connections at elevated temperatures is limited. In this study, 120 single shear bolted connection specimens involving three different thicknesses of thin sheet steels and 30 coupon specimens were conducted by using steady state test method in the temperature range from 22 to 900 °C. There are three main failure modes observed in the single shear bolted connection tests, namely the net section tension, bearing, and tear out. The test results were compared with the predicted values calculated from the American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for cold-formed steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties were used due to the deterioration of material at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the strengths of the single shear bolted connections predicted by the specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. The comparison between the deterioration of the tested connection strengths and that of the material properties at elevated temperatures showed a similar tendency of reduction.},

abstract = {This paper assesses the applicability of the Direct Strength Method (DSM) to calculating the distortional buckling strength of cold-formed thin-walled (CF-TW) steel members with uniform and non-uniform elevated temperature distributions in the cross-section. The assessment was carried out by checking the DSM calculation results with numerical simulation results using the general finite element software ABAQUS which was further validated against ambient and uniform elevated temperature tests on short lipped channel sections, in addition to the author's previous validation studies for thin-walled steel columns with non-uniform temperature distributions. The validated numerical model has been used to generate an extensive database (453) of numerical results of load carrying capacity of CF-TW members with different uniform and non-uniform temperature distributions in the cross-sections, under different boundary and loading conditions and with different dimensions and lengths. It is concluded that the existing DSM distortional buckling curve for ambient temperature application is also applicable for columns with uniform temperature distributions in the cross-section, but is un-conservative for columns with non-uniform temperature distributions in the cross-section. This paper proposes a modification to the distortional buckling curve to enable DSM to deal with distortional buckling in columns with non-uniform temperature distributions.},

abstract = {Throughout the years, different numerical HAM-simulation tools have been developed to assess and predict the heat, air and moisture response of building components. But, though commercially available and commonly applied in building practice, still, several simplifications and shortcomings exist in the common models. Probably the most important one, is the fact that most tools neglect or strongly simplify air transport, focusing only on heat and moisture transport. Especially for the analysis of wood frame constructions, these simplified models may cause a large discrepancy between simulation results and real performance. This study aims at a comparison of the outcomes of numerical HAM-simulations for wood frame constructions with experimental data of real test cases. In particular, the focus of this paper is on cavity ventilation behind brick veneer. Therefore, a simplified version of a wood frame wall with brick veneer cladding is studied in this paper. Different common modelling assumptions are compared. Furthermore, a detailed measuring campaign has been conducted at the VLIET test building of the KU Leuven to validate the different modelling approaches. By verifying the results of the numerical simulations by the data of real test cases, the reliability of the modelling assumptions can be analysed. The results of this study clearly show that simplified assumptions on cavity ventilation in HAM-models might cause large discrepancies between simulation results and in-situ measurements.},

abstract = {This dissertation is intended to provide technical information on the behavior, modeling and design of cold-formed steel (CFS) subjected to fire, grounded on experimental studies and engineering-based numerical analysis of CFS materials, members, connections, and systems at elevated temperatures. The experimental program presented herein includes tensile tests on CFS materials typically used in American and Brazilian building industries; connection tests to determine the stiffness of stud-to-sheathing connections; and column tests on bare and sheathed studs at elevated temperatures. Numerical analysis using the finite strip and finite element methods aims to provide a better understanding of the behavior of CFS members under fire. Numerical results are validated with experimental data, and used to judge the feasibility of current Direct Strength Method (DSM) column equations for fire design applications. Proposed models include equations to estimate the mechanical properties and stress-strain relations for CFS at elevated temperatures, and retention factors for the stiffness of stud-to-sheathing connections. Fire design of CFS based on modest modification to the current DSM is also proposed. Temperature-dependent material models are applied to the numerical study of CFS partition and load-bearing walls, using temperature data from standard fire tests. Results show the development of thermal bowing of walls, and joint opening between sheathing boards under simulated standard fire test conditions. These results potentially provide feedback to couple thermal and mechanical analyses of CFS wall systems. The findings of this work pertain the growth of engineering-based structural analysis method, as a building block for the development of performance-based fire design of CFS structures. Research needs are identified and listed in this document. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.)},

abstract = {The contact of steel columns with building walls is responsible for huge thermal gradients within its cross-section during fire. Current regulatory codes for fire design of steel members provide a formulation to assess the load-bearing capacity of these members assuming uniform temperature through the cross-section; however, this is not what happens in the major part of the cases in real structures where the columns are embedded on walls. The walls on one hand will provide a temperature reduction on the columns, which is somehow favourable in terms of its fire resistance, on the other hand the differential heating on the columns cross-section may lead to unfavourable stresses (bending moments) responsible for instability (thermal bowing). Considering that the structural behaviour of columns is strongly dependent of the second order effects this is an important phenomenon which may lead to a significant reduction on its fire resistance. This paper presents the results of a numerical study to assess the influence of the differential heating on the fire design of steel columns. New interaction axial force–bending moment diagrams for non-uniformly heated H steel columns are proposed.},

abstract = {A numerical parametric investigation into the response of axially and rotationally restrained compound cold-formed steel beams in fire has been carried out. A suitable finite element model was validated against experimental fire tests. Some parameters that could have influence on the behaviour of these beams were evaluated, such as the section geometry, initial applied load, slenderness and influence of the axial and rotational restraints. The results showed that the critical temperature of axially restrained beams may drop significantly (reaching a 50{\%} reduction) and, beyond a certain value of axial or rotational restraint it may be no longer possible to change its fire resistance. Furthermore, it was still concluded that the methods established in EN1993-1.2:2004 are not appropriate for the fire design of these beams (reaching relative differences in the order of 20{\%} and some predictions can be unsafe).},

abstract = {Optimum acoustic performance of building components is a fundamental factor towards sustainable building design. Accordingly, it is essential that designers have the capability to effectively predict the acoustic performance to achieve sustainable designs. This paper introduces a 2-D Harmonic Acoustic Finite Element Analysis to predict the sound insulation of stud based double-leaf walls. This research was motivated by the necessity to develop acoustically efficient light weight building structures, which are both affordable and sustainable. Prediction of the Sound Reduction Index (R) of plasterboard partitions with structural links is a challenging problem due to the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) between the structural and fluid systems. Several finite element models to predict the sound reduction index of double-leaf walls were developed in compliance with BSENISO 717 and 140. The validity of the finite element predictions were assessed by comparison with experimental test results carried out in a certified laboratory. The effect of using different mesh sizes, fixing mechanisms and sound source locations on the predicted sound reduction index were looked into. The effects of air humidity and temperature on the experimental measurements of R values were also investigated. The FEA model presented in this work is capable of predicting the weighted sound reduction index (Rw) along with A-weighted pink noise (C) and A-weighted urban noise (Ctr) to within an accuracy of ±1 dB. Furthermore, the finite element modelling procedure reported can be extended to efficiently predict the acoustic behaviour of other building components undergoing FSI.},

abstract = {This report describes the results of an investigation into the fire performance of laminated veneer lumber (LVL), considering both the early fire hazard and the structural fire performance as well as to develop design methods for the structural performance of LVL beams and columns exposed to post flashover fires. To determine ignition properties cone calorimeter tests were undertaken at heat fluxes varying from 10 to 50 kW/m2, the time to ignition was recorded for each heat flux and for the orientation of the grain being exposed. To determine charring rates cone calorimeter tests were carried out on blocks of LVL with a number of grain orientations, each for a range of heat flux exposures. Instrumented samples samples incorporating embedded thermocouples were used to locate the char front within the sample. Char rates found from the instrumented tests were confirmed on subsequent tests of un-instrumented samples that were subjected to the same heat fluxes but for selected exposure times. Charring Charring experiments were also carried out on three LVL beams, approximately 100 x 300 mm in cross section and 2 m long, tested in a pilot scale furnace following the ISO 834 standard fire curve. Embedded thermocouples were used to record layer temperatures, which were then used to calculate the residual cross section for prediction of structural behaviour in fire conditions. A load-bearing fire resistance test was carried out on a larger LVL beam spanning 4 m in a full size furnace, following the ISO 834 standard fire curve. The report concludes by including design recommendations for a simple method for predicting the fire performance of radiata pine LVL exposed to post-flashover fires.},

abstract = {Light Gauge Steel Framing (LSF) walls made of cold-formed and thin-walled steel lipped channel studs with plasterboard linings on both sides are commonly used in commercial, industrial and residential buildings. However, there is limited data about their structural and thermal performance under fire conditions while past research showed contradicting results about the benefits of using cavity insulation. A new composite wall panel was recently proposed to improve the fire resistance rating of LSF walls, where an insulation layer was used externally between the plasterboards on both sides of the wall frame instead of using it in the cavity. In this research 11 full scale tests were conducted on conventional load bearing steel stud walls with and without cavity insulation, and the new composite panel system to study their thermal and structural performance under standard fire conditions. These tests showed that the use of cavity insulation led to inferior fire performance of walls, and provided supporting research data. They demonstrated that the use of insulation externally in a composite panel enhanced the thermal and structural performance of LSF walls and increased their fire resistance rating. This paper presents the details of the LSF wall tests and the thermal and structural performance data and fire resistance rating of load-bearing wall assemblies lined with varying plasterboard-insulation configurations under two different load ratios. Fire test results including the time–temperature and deflection profiles are presented along with the failure times and modes.},

Material properties at elevated temperatures have a crucial role in fire resistance design of steel structures. The fire resistances of steel structures in the existing international standards are mainly based on experimental data of hot-rolled mild steel. However, investigation of high strength steel at elevated temperatures is limited. Therefore, a test program has been carried out to investigate the material properties of cold-formed high strength steel at elevated temperatures. The coupon specimens were extracted from cold-formed high strength steel square and rectangular hollow sections with nominal yield stresses of 700 and 900 MPa at ambient temperature. The coupon tests were carried out through both steady and transient state test methods for temperatures up to 1000 °C. Material properties including thermal elongation, elastic modulus, yield stress, ultimate strength, ultimate strain and fracture strain were obtained from the tests. The test results were compared with the design values in the European, American, Australian and British standards. The comparison results revealed the necessity of proposing specified design rules for material properties of cold-formed high strength steel at elevated temperatures. New design curves to determine the deterioration of material properties of cold-formed high strength steel at elevated temperatures are proposed. It is shown that the proposed design curves are suitable for high strength steel materials with nominal yield stresses ranged from 690 to 960 MPa at ambient temperature.},

         {\textless}p{\textgreater}Mindfulness is a state of paying conscious and nonjudgmental attention to present‐moment experiences. Previous research relates this state to more effective emotion regulation and less emotion reactivity. We therefore hypothesized an {\textless}i{\textgreater}attenuating{\textless}/i{\textgreater} effect of a mindfulness exercise on moral reactions that usually results from a bad conscience when having caused harm. Across five studies, we experimentally induced mindfulness via a short breathing exercise and then assessed harm‐based moral reactions. As hypothesized, participants in the mindfulness (vs. control) exercise condition showed a) attenuated repair intentions after having read a scenario in which participants caused harm to a friend (Study 3) and b) attenuated intentions to change harm‐causing eating habits (Study 4). Results of Studies 1, 2 and 5 did not provide evidence for our hypothesis. A following meta‐analysis across all five studies yielded an overall significant effect of mindfulness in the harm‐condition, providing preliminary evidence for a potential downside to mindfulness.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

abstract = {The structural fire behavior of typical load-bearing drywall systems, consisting of light cold-formed steel (CFS) studs, sheathed with single or double layers of gypsum plasterboards and air cavity or mineral wool insulation, is investigated. For that purpose, an efficient numerical modeling approach with satisfying accuracy is developed and validated against experimental and numerical results available in the literature. Heat transfer and structural analyses of the investigated drywall assemblies are carried out, employing the computational tools ANSYS CFX and ADINA, respectively. Transient heat transfer analyses provide the spatial and temporal temperature variation over the drywall assembly, which is assumed to be exposed to the standard ISO 834 fire curve from one side. Thermal simulation results are then introduced in the subsequent structural analyses, where the load-bearing capacity of the CFS studs under fire conditions is estimated, by means of Geometry and Material Nonlinear Analyses accounting for Imperfections (GMNIA). The load-bearing capacity assuming uniform cross-sectional temperature distributions is also evaluated and compared to the respective predictions under non-uniform temperature profiles. Results obtained by varying the imposed load or the applied temperature (fire duration), are compared to predictions of existing and literature-proposed fire design guidelines. EN 1993-1-2 provisions lead to average underestimation of the load-bearing capacity by approximately 20{\%}, while the literature-proposed methods are found to underestimate the load-bearing capacity by 5{\%} to 15{\%}. The limitation of using a critical temperature of 350°C for the structural fire design of thin-walled sections is found to be rather conservative, since the investigated CFS studs are able to exhibit satisfying fire performance also under higher temperature conditions.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of eight tests on loaded full-scale cold-formed thin-walled steel structural panels, two tests at ambient temperature and six exposed to the standard fire condition on one side. The test panels used two types of lipped channels, 100×54×15×1.2 mm or 100×54×15×2 mm, each channel having two service holes, one near the top and one near the bottom. Three different load levels, being 0.2, 0.4 and 0.7 times the load carrying capacity of the same panel tested at ambient temperature, were applied during the six fire tests. At ambient temperature, failure was local buckling around the top service hole. Under fire condition, the main failure mode was overall flexural–torsional buckling about the major axis, with the lateral deformations of the test panels being mainly caused by thermal bowing due to temperature gradients. The interior insulation in some tests was burnt through and this had noticeable influence on temperature developments in the test steel channels. In two fire tests using the thinner channels, the test panels failed before 30 min that is considered to be the minimum standard fire rating of this type of construction.},

abstract = {Multi-storey buildings with precast hollowcore concrete floor systems are very common in New Zealand and in many other countries, but the structural behaviour of such systems under fire exposure is not easy to predict because of the complex geometry, composite construction, and a wide range of possible support conditions. The 2006 version of the New Zealand Concrete Standard NZS3101 introduces new details for connection of hollowcore floor units to reinforced concrete supporting beams to improve seismic performance, but the fire performance of the new connection systems is unknown. Currently available methods for simulating fire performance of hollowcore slabs are not suitable for design purposes. Therefore, a simple yet sufficiently accurate simulation method needs to be developed. This study was carried out using a proposed simulation method to investigate the fire performance of hollowcore floor slabs with different connection details between the hollowcore units and their reinforced concrete supporting beams conforming to NZS3101. The proposed simulation method is examined on the platform of SAFIR, a non-linear finite element program that includes both thermal and structural analysis. The proposed simulation method was validated using available experimental results from a limited number of tests. It does not take account of shear and anchorage failures or spalling effects, so designers should consult other studies for this behaviour of hollowcore concrete flooring systems. By using the proposed simulation scheme in SAFIR, it is investigated whether the tensile membrane action established through beams parallel to the hollowcore units and different floor aspect ratios will enhance the fire resistance of hollowcore concrete flooring systems. From the simulation results it is concluded that rigid connections at both the ends and the sides of the hollowcore flooring systems to the supporting beams provide better fire resistance than rotationally flexible connections, and the fire resistance of hollowcore flooring systems can be increased by using stiffer supporting beams at the end of the slabs and also by decreasing the spacing between the beams parallel to the hollowcore units.},

abstract = {Typical load-bearing light gauge steel frame (LSF) walls are made of conventional lipped channel section studs and gypsum plasterboards. Current research at the Queensland University of Technology is investigating the effects of using new thin-walled stud sections on the fire-resistant rating of LSF walls, in particular, the use of hollow flange channel (HFC) sections. A sound knowledge on the thermal performance of these LSF walls is essential, but expensive and time-consuming nature of fire tests has acted as a barrier. In this study, finite element models were developed to predict the thermal performance of load-bearing LSF walls made of HFC section studs exposed to fire on one side. The developed models were validated using the results of five full-scale standard fire tests of LSF walls. They were then extended to perform a parametric study where the effects of stud dimensions, geometries, spacings and wall configuration were evaluated. The hot and cold flange time-temperature profiles of HFC studs were developed as a function of the aforementioned parameters, which can be used to predict the fire resistance ratings of LSF walls. This paper presents the fire tests, and the details of the developed finite element models and the thermal performance results of LSF walls made of HFC studs.

Conventionally, increased fire rating is provided simply by adding more plasterboards to Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) stud walls, which is inefficient. However, recently Kolarkar {\&} Mahendran (2008) developed a new composite wall panel system, where the insulation was located externally between the plasterboards on both sides of the steel wall frame. Numerical and experimental studies were undertaken to investigate the structural and fire performance of LSF walls using the new composite panels under axial compression. This paper presents the details of the numerical studies of the new LSF walls and the results. It also includes brief details of the experimental studies. Experimental and numerical results were compared for the purpose of validating the developed numerical model. The paper also describes the structural and fire performance of the new LSF wall system in comparison to traditional wall systems using cavity insulation.},

abstract = {The load-bearing light-gauge steel-framed (LSF) wall systems used in buildings are protected against fire by attaching fire-resistant gypsum plasterboard layers on both sides. They are also provided with cavity insulation to improve the thermal comfort of buildings during severe hot and cold weather conditions. However, recent research studies have shown that cavity insulation reduces the fire performance of load-bearing LSF walls. Therefore, researchers at the Queensland University of Technology proposed the use of externally insulated LSF walls and floors where insulation is sandwiched between the inner and outer layers of plasterboard instead of being placed inside the cavity. This article reviews and evaluates the results from the small- and full-scale fire tests and numerical studies performed on such externally insulated wall and floor systems exposed to standard and code-prescribed parametric fire curves. Comparison of the fire-resistance ratings and time-temperature profiles of the cavity-insulated and externally insulated wall and floor systems confirmed the superior fire performance of externally insulated load-bearing LSF walls and floors compared with cavity-insulated systems. The reasons for the superior fire performance are discussed in this article. This research also found that placing the plasterboard joints along the studs had minimum detrimental effects on the fire performance of externally insulated LSF wall systems. Overall, this research recommends the use of externally insulated wall and floor systems instead of cavity-insulated systems because of their thermal comfort and superior fire performance. This article includes the details of an efficient LSF wall construction process based on the use of composite panels consisting of two plasterboard layers with insulation sandwiched between them.},

abstract = {Light gauge steel frames (LSF) are commonly used in floor systems. The LSF floor systems must be designed to serve as fire compartment boundaries and provide adequate fire resistance. However, limited research has been undertaken on LSF floor systems, particularly on those made of high strength steel joists, and hence a thorough understanding of their fire resistance behaviour is not available. Recently a new composite floor system was also developed to provide higher fire resistance rating. But its increased fire rating could not be determined using the currently available design methods. This paper presents the details of finite element models of high strength LSF floor systems developed to simulate their structural performance under standard fire conditions. The numerical analyses of LSF floor joists were undertaken using the finite element program ABAQUS based on the measured time–temperature profiles obtained from full scale fire tests under both steady state and transient state conditions. Finite element models were calibrated using full scale fire test results and used to further investigate the structural fire behaviour of LSF floor systems. Numerical analyses provided a good understanding of the structural fire behaviour of LSF floor systems and confirmed the superior performance of the new composite floor system. This paper has shown that fire resistance ratings of a range of LSF floor systems can be predicted from the critical average joist temperature obtained from finite element analyses.},

abstract = {Although a few fire experiments have been carried out on load-bearing cold-formed steel (CFS) wall systems, the understanding of their fire performance is still limited, and further parametric analysis on the basis of such experiments is expensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a simplified numerical approach to predicting the thermal and mechanical responses of CFS wall systems in fire. Thermal physical property experiments were carried out to measure the essential material properties. With those material properties as inputs, a one-dimensional thermal response model was developed to predict the heat transfer across the cross section of CFS wall systems. Both heat convection and radiation were considered in the thermal boundary conditions. The governing equation was expressed in the form of implicit finite-differential equations and solved using the Gauss-Seidel method. The model predictions of temperature responses of CFS wall systems were in good agreement with the measured temperature responses in the fire experiments and also compared well with the modeling results in literature with improved efficiency and convergence in computation. In addition, a thermomechanical response model was developed to predict the time-dependent lateral deflection and fire resistance time for CFS wall systems in fire and was validated by the experimental results in literature.

abstract = {Building standards incorporating quantitative acoustical criteria to ensure adequate sound insulation are now being implemented. Engineers are making great efforts to design acoustically efficient double-wall structures. Accordingly, efficient simulation models to predict the acoustic insulation of double-leaf wall structures are needed. This paper presents the development of a numerical tool that can predict the frequency dependent sound reduction index R of stud based double-leaf walls at one-third-octave band frequency range. A fully vibro-acoustic 3D model consisting of two rooms partitioned using a double-leaf wall, considering the structure and acoustic fluid coupling incorporating the existing fluid and structural solvers are presented. The validity of the finite element (FE) model is assessed by comparison with experimental test results carried out in a certified laboratory. Accurate representation of the structural damping matrix to effectively predict the R values are studied. The possibilities of minimising the simulation time using a frequency dependent mesh model was also investigated. The FEA model presented in this work is capable of predicting the weighted sound reduction index Rw along with A-weighted pink noise C and A-weighted urban noise Ctr within an error of 1 dB. The model developed can also be used to analyse the acoustically induced frequency dependent geometrical behaviour of the double-leaf wall components to optimise them for best acoustic performance. The FE modelling procedure reported in this paper can be extended to other building components undergoing fluid–structure interaction (FSI) to evaluate their acoustic insulation.},

abstract = {The performance of gypsum plasterboard assemblies is typically evaluated in accordance with standardised test methods such as BS476, AS1530 or ASTM E119. Standard time-temperature curves give good comparison between tested materials. However, they are generally less severe than a typical short duration compartment fire, they do not have a decay phase, and may be conservative for long duration fires. It is not common knowledge that test time-temperature relationships, such as ISO834, have not significantly changed since they were originally formulated in the early 1930's. Full-scale compartment testing based on typical residential scenarios conducted as part of this study, revealed that temperatures within a compartment can far exceed those of standard time-temperature curves within several minutes of ignition. Pilot-scale furnace testing to non-standard time-temperature curves has revealed that the performance of light framed gypsum plasterboard assemblies is highly dependent on the severity of the fire exposure. A system that has achieved a fire resistance rating of 60 minutes failed within 30 minutes to a fire exposure that would represent a moderate compartment fire. Current fire engineering designs often use sophisticated evacuation models to calculate minimum escape times required for safe evacuation of occupants. These evacuation times typically fall in the range from 15 - 60 minutes. The suitability of protecting escape routes using barriers rated against a standard fire test is questioned. SAPIR, a powerful finite element program, has been employed to predict the thermal behaviour of various gypsum plasterboard assemblies exposed to a range of nonstandard fires. Results from the computer modelling are compared with several full and pilot scale furnace tests. It was found that the model calibrated to results from standard ISO834 furnace testing provided reasonable predictions of temperatures within assemblies exposed to a moderate fire. Temperature predictions of assemblies exposed to severe fires were poor.},

abstract = {Gypsum board is a widespread fire barrier used in house and general building construction. Gypsum board partitions and ceiling membranes are possibly the most common fire resistant construction approach employed in an extensive range of building types. The utilization of gypsum board as prime fire protection of light-flame wood or steel construction is ubiquitous. Gypsum board based systems are among those now broadly used, as walls or ceilings and it is principally employed as lining material in light-weight construction, which is a competent and cost effective technique of providing flexible partitioning assemblies in commercial and residential buildings. The thickness of the gypsum board lining and the configuration of the framing can be flexibly changed to meet specified fire performance requirements. The use of such systems is increasing every day and there demands to be more research on their properties and behaviour. This paper presents the properties of gypsum board which include the assemblies and standard fire tests and the thermal properties of gypsum in general and includes suggested properties of gypsum by different researchers.

abstract = {Gypsum plasterboard is a common lining material used in cold-formed steel wall frame systems. It is used either with lipped or unlipped (plain) C-section studs in the construction of both the load bearing and non-load bearing walls in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. The design of these wall frames does not utilise the full strengthening effects of the plasterboard in carrying the axial loads. An experimental study has shown that the strength of the studs in compression was increased significantly when they were lined with plasterboard on one or both sides. In order to fully understand the behaviour of both sides lined steel wall frames, a finite element model was developed and validated using experimental results. This was followed by a detailed parametric study using finite element analyses. This paper presents the details of the finite element modelling of both sides lined wall frames and the results. A design method based on appropriate effective length factors was developed within the provisions of Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures to predict the ultimate loads and failure modes of both sides lined steel wall frames. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The systems have often load-bearing walls and the floors may be of lightweight steel profiles or concrete. Such systems are suited for industrial production and can contribute to a more efficient building process. Examples of components and systems are given in the paper. For low and medium rise buildings it is natural to use the walls as stabilising for horizontal loads from wind and imperfections. In Sweden and Finland this has been common practice for single-family timber houses since the 1970s. The paper describes the traditional design model for walls with single-layer gypsum plasterboards and an extension to double layers, which are needed for fire protection in multi-storey buildings.},

abstract = {In this paper, the authors present experimental observations and results of full scale standard fire tests as well as thermo-mechanical sequentially coupled finite element simulations on partition walls. A procedure for carrying out numerical simulation of the coupled-thermo-mechanical behaviour is proposed. The numerical models presented for predicting behaviour during fires were calibrated and verified by full scale fire testing. The test wall was constructed using steel C-section studs with gypsum boards fixed on both sides. The wall cavity was filled with Rockwool insulation. The partition wall was tested during exposure to the standard fire test. The thermo-mechanical behaviour of the wall was found to be heavily coupled and influenced by the physical and chemical changes in all constituents of the wall during exposure to fire. The sequentially coupled mechanical response simulation included geometric and material non-linearity as a function of temperature. In spite of the complexity of the fire effects and the strongly coupled thermo- mechanical behaviour, the results of the computational model practically agree with the full scale experimental results. The numerical prediction of the maximum thermal bowing of the wall was found to be very similar to the maximum values measured during the fire test. This has practical implications for assessing the integrity such wall assemblies during exposure to elevated temperatures. The proposed procedure can be used by fire structural engineers and fire testing laboratories as a tool to assist technical assessment exercises. In addition, the proposed procedure can be used during the developmental and modification stages of building components to optimise performance during fire.},

abstract = {A comprehensive experimental programme was contrived with the aim of investigating the behaviour and the capacity of cold-formed steel built-up columns with particular emphasis on the effects of connector spacing and contact between individual components. A total of 24 built-up columns, including four different cross-sectional geometries, were tested between pin-ended boundary conditions, while applying the load with nominal eccentricities of L/1000 or L/1500. The columns were designed to fail by interaction of cross-sectional buckling of the components, possible global-type buckling of the components between connectors and global buckling of the whole column, and all these failure modes were successfully achieved. The built-up sections were fabricated from flat plates, plain channels and lipped channels and were assembled with either bolts or self-drilling screws. The connector spacing was varied between specimens of the same cross-sectional geometry. Tensile coupons were taken from the flat portions and the corners of the sections in order to determine their material properties, while detailed measurements of the geometric imperfections of each specimen were also carried out using a specially designed measuring rig. In addition, the isolated behaviour of both the bolts and the screws used in the specimens was investigated through single lap shear tests. It was observed that the buckling patterns in the built-up specimens were affected by contact between the various components and by the spacing between the connectors. However, in the cases where global buckling of the components in between connector points was not critical, the connector spacing had a minor influence on the ultimate capacity of the columns.},

This paper brings together existing research on cold-formed steel materials, members, and assemblages at elevated temperatures; and complementary analysis and design methods necessary for the development of analysis-based design for cold-formed steel systems under fire. Cold-formed steel systems have become popular in building construction as both load-bearing and non-load-bearing elements, primarily due to their high strength-to-weight ratio and ease of construction. Consequently, design specifications, and structural analysis tools have rapidly evolved to facilitate engineering design of these complex thin-walled members. However, in fires the performance of cold-formed steel systems are assured by prescriptive detailing and standardized testing. Today, engineering knowledge is rapidly advancing, providing the opportunity to contemplate, analysis-based design as an enabling tool for general performance-based engineering of cold-formed steel systems for fire. The review provided here includes experimental results on mechanical and thermal properties of cold-formed steel and temperature dependent constitutive relations, subsystem testing and computational simulations, and analysis models and exploratory methods for fire design, i.e., the building blocks towards performance-based fire design for cold-formed steel systems.},

abstract = {Gypsum plasterboard wall assemblies are extensively used as cladding material for walls, floors and ceilings, as well as a means for passive fire protection of timber structures. The good fire resistance characteristics of gypsum plasterboards are mainly owed to the gypsum dehydration process, occurring between 80 °C and 250 °C, where large quantities of energy are absorbed by evaporating water molecules, bound in the gypsum's crystal lattice. Aiming to enhance the prediction quality of numerical simulation tools, utilized to support the performance-based fire design of modern buildings, a gypsum dehydration numerical model is developed and validated. The model focuses on accurately describing the physical and chemical phenomena characterizing the gypsum dehydration process by employing a modelling approach based on solid reaction kinetics; temperature-dependent thermo-physical properties are also taken into account. The developed model is implemented in a Computational Fluid Dynamics code. Numerical results are validated by comparison to available temperature measurements obtained in a gypsum plasterboard wall assembly tested in a small-scale fire resistance furnace. Predictions of the developed model are found to agree reasonably well with the experimental data; a series of parametric studies is also performed aiming to investigate the effect of various modelling parameters. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Heat transfer to a gas turbine blade was computationally simulated by finite element methods and probabilistically evaluated in view of the several uncertainties in the performance parameters. Cumulative distribution functions and sensitivity factors were computed for thermal stresses due to the thermal random variables. These results can be used to quickly identify the most critical design variables in order to optimize the design and make it cost effective. The analysis leads to the selection of the appropriate materials to be used and to the identification of both the most critical measurements and parameters. Conventional engineering design methods are deterministic. The components of a machine are considered as ideal systems and parameter optimization provide single point estimates of the system response. In reality, many engineering systems are stochastic where a probability assessment of the results is required. Probabilistic engineering design analysis assumes probability distributions of design parameters, instead of mean values only. This enables the designer to design for a specific reliability and hence maximize safety, quality and cost. The approaches for incorporating probabilistic effects in design include the use of factors of safety, the use of the worst-case design and the use of probabilistic design. Utilizing the uncertainties in the estimations, deterministic engineering design uses factors of safety to assure that the nominal operational conditions does not come too close to the point where the system will fail. The approximation of minimum properties and maximum loads known as the absolute worst case gives information about this critical point. This approach limits the optimization capability of a system and fails to provide important information about the system lifetime. {\textcopyright} Freund Publishing House Ltd.},

abstract = {Fire safety has become an important part in structural design due to the ever increasing loss of properties and lives during fires. Conventionally the fire rating of load bearing wall systems made of Light gauge Steel Frames (LSF) is determined using fire tests based on the standard time–temperature curve in ISO834 (ISO 834-1, 1999 [1]). However, modern commercial and residential buildings make use of thermoplastic materials, which mean considerably high fuel loads. Hence a detailed fire research study into the fire performance of LSF walls was undertaken using realistic design fire curves developed based on Eurocode parametric (ENV 1991-1-2, 2002 [2]) and Barnett's BFD (Barnett, 2002 [3]) curves using both full scale fire tests and numerical studies. It included LSF walls without cavity insulation, and the recently developed externally insulated composite panel system. This paper presents the details of finite element models developed to simulate the full scale fire tests of LSF wall panels under realistic design fires. Finite element models of LSF walls exposed to realistic design fires were developed, and analysed under both transient and steady state fire conditions using the measured stud time–temperature curves. Transient state analyses were performed to simulate fire test conditions while steady state analyses were performed to obtain the load ratio versus time and failure temperature curves of LSF walls. Details of the developed finite element models and the results including the axial deformation and lateral deflection versus time curves, and the stud failure modes and times are presented in this paper. Comparison with fire test results demonstrate the ability of developed finite element models to predict the performance and fire resistance ratings of LSF walls under realistic design fires.},

Only panels with flat steel faces are considered. Simple mechanisms of instability are described, load actions are quantified, and practical design guidance is given to ensure stability i.e., resistance to overall collapse. The analysis for ceilings assumes that, after delamination of the fire exposed steel face due to softening of the adhesive, the panel faces act as catenaries, and calculations are made of mid-span deflection and the catenary force needed to resist collapse. This method is being considered in the work of European committee CEN TC 127 with regard to the development of rules for extended applications for construction products. The analysis for internal fire walls takes account of wind pressure. The importance of achieving adequate panel-end restraint is demonstrated.},

abstract = {Traditionally, the fire resistance rating of Light gauge steel frame (LSF) wall systems is based on approximate prescriptive methods developed using limited fire tests. These fire tests are conducted using standard fire time-temperature curve given in ISO 834. However, in recent times fire has become a major disaster in buildings due to the increase in fire loads as a result of modern furniture and lightweight construction, which make use of thermoplastics materials, synthetic foams and fabrics. Therefore a detailed research study into the performance of load bearing LSF wall systems under both standard and realistic design fires on one side was undertaken to develop improved fire design rules. This study included both full scale fire tests and numerical studies of eight different LSF wall systems conducted for both the standard fire curve and the recently developed realistic design fire curves. The use of previous fire design rules developed for LSF walls subjected to non-uniform elevated temperature distributions based on AISI design manual and Eurocode 3 Parts 1.2 and 1.3 was investigated first. New simplified fire design rules based on AS/NZS 4600, North American Specification and Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 were then proposed with suitable allowances for the interaction effects of compression and bending actions. The importance of considering thermal bowing, magnified thermal bowing and neutral axis shift in the fire design was also investigated and their effects were included. A spread sheet based design tool was developed based on the new design rules to predict the failure load ratio versus time and temperature curves for varying LSF wall configurations. The accuracy of the proposed design rules was verified using the fire test and finite element analysis results for various wall configurations, steel grades, thicknesses and load ratios under both standard and realistic design fire conditions. A simplified method was also proposed to predict the fire resistance rating of LSF walls based on two sets of equations developed for the load ratio-hot flange temperature and the time-temperature relationships. This paper presents the details of this study on LSF wall systems under fire conditions and the results.},

The test strengths and observed failure modes were compared with the design strengths and failure modes predicted by the Direct Strength Method.

However, unclassified boards with varying composition and more notably with ambiguous thermal properties are increasingly becoming available in the market. Therefore a study was undertaken with an aim to set minimum standards for fire protective boards used in LSF wall applications. This paper presents the details of this study based on material characterisation and finite element thermal modelling of the most commonly used fire protective board, gypsum plasterboards, to address these critical issues related to fire safety design. In the material characterisation phase of this study, thermal properties of three different gypsum plasterboards manufactured in Australia were measured, analysed and compared. Subsequently, it proposes a thermal property based “k-factor” capable of giving an overall measure of the fire performance of boards, so that it can be used in appropriately classifying fire protective boards. As it is not known how this factor relates to the overall fire performance of LSF wall systems, numerical models were also developed and used to simulate the performance of LSF walls exposed to the standard fire. Finally, a correlation between time-temperature profiles from numerical analyses and calculated k-factors was established.},

abstract = {This paper describes a full-scale natural fire test to investigate the collapse behaviour of a single storey cold-formed steel (CFS) building, designed to behave in a specified way in a severe fire, with roof venting and partial wall collapse. The test building had a span of 8 m, height-to-eaves of 2.15 m, and length of 10 m. The walls of the CFS building were constructed from cantilever ‘stud {\&} track' panels, with stud spacing of 0.6 m. The roof of the building comprised CFS trusses pinned to the wall connection plates at the top. In this fire test, walls on two adjacent sides were lined internally with fire resistant lining to achieve a structural fire resistance of 30 min (R30) and the calculated fire load was provided to generate a structural fire severity of 30 min, taking into account roof venting. Thus the two protected walls were expected to remain vertical throughout the fire; the roof was expected to collapse first, followed by pulling in of the unprotected walls. The CFS cantilever wall/roof truss system collapsed with an inwards asymmetrical collapse mechanism at a truss temperature of 622.5 °C, with collapse being due to member buckling of the non-fire rated wall rather than failure of the screws or joints. A non-linear finite-element (FE) model is then described. The collapse temperature predicted using the FE was 628.2 °C, with a deformed shape similar to that observed in the fire test. The FE model has matched the experimental behaviour, thus making this model useful in understanding and predicting the behaviour of CFS cantilever wall/truss system in severe fire conditions.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel members are widely used in residential, industrial and commercial buildings as primary load-bearing elements. During fire events, they will be exposed to elevated temperatures. If the general appearance of the structure is satisfactory after a fire event then the question that has to be answered is how the load bearing capacity of cold-formed steel members in these buildings has been affected. Hence after such fire events there is a need to evaluate the residual strength of these members. However, the post-fire behaviour of cold-formed steel members has not been investigated in the past. This means conservative decisions are likely to be made in relation to fire exposed cold-formed steel buildings. Therefore an experimental study was undertaken to investigate the post-fire mechanical properties of cold-formed steels. Tensile coupons taken from cold-formed steel sheets of three different steel grades and thicknesses were exposed to different elevated temperatures up to 800 °C, and were then allowed to cool down to ambient temperature before they were tested to failure. Tensile coupon tests were conducted to obtain their post-fire stress–strain curves and associated mechanical properties (yield stress, Young׳s modulus, ultimate strength and ductility). It was found that the post-fire mechanical properties of cold-formed steels are reduced below the original ambient temperature mechanical properties if they had been exposed to temperatures exceeding 300 °C. Hence a new set of equations is proposed to predict the post-fire mechanical properties of cold-formed steels. Such post-fire mechanical property assessments allow structural and fire engineers to make an accurate prediction of the safety of fire exposed cold-formed steel buildings. This paper presents the details of this experimental study and the results of post-fire mechanical properties of cold-formed steels. It also includes the results of a post-fire evaluation of cold-formed steel walls.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Following this recommendation, this paper presents two new interfaces in fire-thermal-structural analysis. The first interface uses adiabatic surface temperatures to provide an efficient way of transferring thermal results from a fire simulation to a thermal analysis. It assigns these temperatures to surface elements of structural members based on proximity and directionality. The second interface allows the transfer of temperature results from a thermal analysis modeled with solid elements to a structural analysis modeled with beams and shells. The interface also allows the reverse, namely the geometric updating of the thermal model with deflections and strains obtained from the structural analysis. This last step is particularly useful in intense fires of long duration, where significant deflections and strains could cause damage to insulation and displace the structure to a different thermal regime. The procedures can be used for a variety of fire simulation, thermal, and structural analysis software.},

To verify the accuracy of thermal properties in Eurocode 3 Part 1.2 for the cold-formed steel components used in LSF construction, a series of thermal property tests was conducted based on the ASTM standard test methods. Thermal property tests were conducted to determine the specific heat at constant pressure, relative density, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of three types of carbon steels, namely Grade 500 steel, Grade 300 steel and Grade 140 steel, due to their use in LSF construction. Test results showed the differences between the Eurocode 3 Part 1.2 model for carbon steels and the measured thermal property data for both specific heat and thermal conductivity of all three types of carbon steels due to chemical composition and the influence of carbon content. Hence, new equations were developed for specific heat and thermal conductivity for the selected carbon steels. To verify the effect of the measured thermal property results, 3-D heat transfer models of LSF floor-ceiling systems were developed and analysed. New thermal properties of carbon steels were used as inputs and comparisons made against fire test results for validation purposes. This paper presents the thermal properties of three selected carbon steels, which are commonly used in cold-formed LSF systems and the results.},

abstract = {Purpose - This research was aimed at investigating the fire performance of LSF wall systems by using 3-D heat transfer FEmodels of existing LSF wall system configurations. Design/methodology/approach - This research was focused on investigating the fire performance of LSF wall systems by using 3-D heat transfer finite element models of existing LSF wall system configurations. The analysis results were validated by using the available fire test results of five different LSF wall configurations. Findings - The validated finite element models were used to conduct a parametric study on a range of nonload bearing and load bearing LSF wall configurations to predict their fire resistance levels (FRLs) for varying load ratios. Originality/value - Fire performance of LSF wall systems with different configurations can be understood by performing full-scale fire tests. However, these full-scale fire tests are time consuming, labour intensive and expensive. On the other hand, finite element analysis (FEA) provides a simple method of investigating the fire performance of LSF wall systems to understand their thermal-mechanical behaviour. Recent numerical research studies have focused on investigating the fire performances of LSF wall systems by using finite element (FE) models. Most of these FE models were developed based on 2-D FE platform capable of performing either heat transfer or structural analysis separately. Therefore, this paper presents the details of a 3-D FEA methodology to develop the capabilities to perform fully-coupled thermal-mechanical analyses of LSF walls exposed to fire in future.},

The critical temperature and the corresponding displacement of screwed connections were obtained from the transient state test curves. The test strengths obtained from the transient state tests are similar to those obtained from the steady state tests. The failure modes such as tilting and bearing, screw shear, bearing, and teat out failure were observed in the transient tests.

abstract = {Cold-formed steel sections are commonly used in low-rise commercial and residential buildings. During fire events, cold-formed steel structural elements in these buildings can be exposed to elevated temperatures. Hence after such events there is a need to evaluate their residual strengths. However, only limited information is available in relation to the residual strength of fire exposed cold-formed steel sections. This research is aimed at investigating the distortional buckling capacities of fire exposed cold-formed lipped channel sections. A series of compression tests of fire exposed, short lipped channel columns made of varying steel grades and thicknesses was undertaken in this research. Test columns were first exposed to different elevated temperatures up to 800 oC, and then tested to failure after cooling down. Suitable finite element models were developed with post-fire mechanical properties to simulate the behaviour of tested columns and were validated using test results. The residual compression capacities of short columns were also predicted using the current cold-formed steel standards and compared with test and finite element analysis results. This comparison showed that ambient temperature design rules for columns can be used to predict the residual compression capacities of fire exposed short or laterally restrained cold-formed steel columns provided the maximum temperature experienced by the column can be estimated after a fire event. Such residual capacity assessments will allow engineers to evaluate the safety of fire exposed buildings. This paper presents the details of this experimental study, finite element analyses and the results.},

abstract = {A research project was conducted at University of Naples “Federico II” over the last few years with the aim to give a contribute to overcome the lack of information on seismic behaviour of architectural non-structural lightweight steel (LWS) drywall components, i.e. indoor partition walls, outdoor fa{\c{c}}ades and suspended continuous ceilings. The tested non-structural components were made of LWS frames sheathed with gypsum-based or cement-based boards. The research activity was organized in three levels: ancilliary tests, component tests and assembly tests. Ancilliary tests were carried out for evaluating the local behaviour of partitions, fa{\c{c}}ades and ceilings. Component tests involved out-of-plane quasi-static monotonic and dynamic identification tests and in-plane quasi-static reversed cyclic tests on partitions. Finally, the dynamic behaviour was investigated through shake table tests on different assemblages of partitions, fa{\c{c}}ades and ceilings. The study demonstrated that the tested architectural non-structural LWS drywall components are able to exhibit a very good seismic behaviour with respect to the damage limit states according to the IDR limits given by Eurocode 8 Part 1. The current paper describes the complete experimental activity within the project.},

abstract = {This paper presents the mechanical properties data for cold-formed steel at elevated temperatures. The deterioration of the mechanical properties of yield strength (0.2{\%} proof stress) and elastic modulus are the primary properties in the design and analysis of cold-formed steel structures under fire. However, values of these properties at different temperatures are not well reported. Therefore, both steady and transient tensile coupon tests were conducted at different temperatures ranged approximately from 20 to 1000 °C for obtaining the mechanical properties of cold-formed steel structural material. This study included cold-formed steel grades G550 and G450 with plate thickness of 1.0 and 1.9 mm, respectively. Curves of elastic modulus, yield strength obtained at different strain levels, ultimate strength, ultimate strain and thermal elongation versus different temperatures are plotted and compared with the results obtained from the Australian, British, European standards and the test results predicted by other researchers. A unified equation for yield strength, elastic modulus, ultimate strength and ultimate strain of cold-formed steel at elevated temperatures is proposed in this paper. A full strain range expression up to the ultimate tensile strain for the stress-strain curves of cold-formed carbon steel at elevated temperatures is also proposed in this paper. It is shown that the proposed equation accurately predicted the test results. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper summarized numerous studies on three types of composite walls (CWs), namely, double-skinned profiled steel sheeting, double-skinned flat steel sheeting, and profiled-flat sheeting with or without infill materials. CWs were classified based on the type of sheeting (profiled, flat, and dry board) and the applied loading (axial, cyclic, lateral, impact, thermal, or a combination of any two). The interaction between sheets and infill material was reviewed in detail through classification. Afterward, the effect of openings on the structural behavior of DSCWs was studied and explained in detail. Finally, all previous studies were remarked on and reported in comprehensive tables, which present the parameters studied and the remarks made on each study.},

abstract = {Cold-formed Hollow Flange Channel (HFC) sections can be used in Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems due to their structural efficiency. Recent experimental and finite element analysis based investigations conducted by the authors have demonstrated the superior fire performance of LSF walls made of welded HFC sections. The authors have developed a wide range of fire performance data of LSF walls through a finite element analysis (FEA) based extensive parametric study. This paper investigates the applicability of the available fire design rules to predict their structural capacities. Since fire design rules were not available for HFC sections, the latest design rules for LCS studs subjected to non-uniform temperature distributions were selected for evaluation from the pool of various design rules given in standards and previous studies. Suitable modifications were then incorporated for simplification and improved accuracy. Two improved design methods based on AS/NZS 4600 and Eurocode 3 were proposed. The structural capacity of HFC section stud found from the design rule predictions was converted into load ratio which is the ratio between the structural capacities under fire and ambient conditions, and the load ratio versus FRR curve were produced for different LSF walls. These were then compared with the FEA results, to verify the accuracy of the proposed design rules. This paper also presents suitable DSM based design method proposed for HFC section studs subject to non-uniform temperature distributions in LSF walls, and verifies its accuracy.},

abstract = {Different numerical methods have been implemented to simulate internal natural convection heat transfer and also to identify the most accurate and efficient one. A laterally heated square enclosure, filled with air, was studied. A FORTRAN code based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) was developed for this purpose. The finite difference method was applied to discretize the LBM equations. Furthermore, for comparison purpose, the commercially available CFD package FLUENT, which uses finite volume Method (FVM), was also used to simulate the same problem. Different discretization schemes, being the first order upwind, second order upwind, power law, and QUICK, were used with the finite volume solver where the SIMPLE and SIMPLEC algorithms linked the velocity-pressure terms. The results were also compared with existing experimental and numerical data. It was observed that the finite volume method requires less CPU usage time and yields more accurate results compared to the LBM. It has been noted that the 1st order upwind/SIMPLEC combination converges comparatively quickly with a very high accuracy especially at the boundaries. Interestingly, all variants of FVM discretization/pressure- velocity linking methods lead to almost the same number of iterations to converge but higher-order schemes ask for longer iterations. {\textcopyright} 2014 M.

Gypsum board partitions and ceiling membranes are possibly the most common fire resistant construction approach employed in an extensive range of building types. The utilization of gypsum board as prime fire protection of light-flame wood or steel construction is ubiquitous. Gypsum board based systems are among those now broadly used, as walls or ceilings and it is principally employed as lining material in light-weight construction, which is a competent and cost effective technique of providing flexible partitioning assemblies in commercial and residential buildings. The thickness of the gypsum board lining and the configuration of the framing can be flexibly changed to meet specified fire performance requirements. The use of such systems is increasing every day and there demands to be more research on their properties and behaviour. This paper presents the properties of gypsum board which include the assemblies and standard fire tests and the thermal properties of gypsum in general and includes suggested properties of gypsum by different researchers.

abstract = {This paper presents results of large-scale experiments with varying levels of fire severity on lateral force-resisting systems commonly used in cold-formed steel framed buildings. Gypsum-sheet steel composite panel sheathed walls, oriented strand board sheathed walls, and steel strap-braced walls are examined. Postflashover fire conditions of two different intensities as well as 1 hour of fire exposure similar to that in a standard furnace qualification test are studied. Additionally, a full-scale furnished kitchen fire experiment is conducted for comparison. The results highlight differences in the thermal response and subsequent performance of the walls as well as differing sensitives of the walls to pre-damage, eg, that might occur during an earthquake. The results are part of a larger effort to provide fragilities for these wall systems in response to realistic fires for performance-based design.},

These are two-phase systems that employ capillary forces instead of pumps to circulate the coolant. In these devices, the coolant evaporates and condenses in the evaporator and condenser, respectively. The condensed coolant liquid is driven toward the evaporator by capillary action in a wick structure located inside the evaporator. A mechanical pump is added to the liquid line of the loop to reach the distributed heat loads while controlling the temperature to produce an isothermal surface. In this work, flow patterns and heat transfer in the LHP evaporator wick is studied for various flow rates of the working fluid, wick thermal conductivity, porosity and permeability of wick, heat flux, and gravity condition. A CFD model has been developed to predict the performance of LHP due to the change in these parameters. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) model in ANSYS Fluent was modified using a User Defined Function (UDF) to calculate mass transfer between the liquid and vapor phases at the interface. The Lee phase change model was used to calculate the mass flux due to evaporation and condensation.},

abstract = {The companion paper has presented results of elevated temperature tests on 52 cold-formed thin-walled channels under compressive load. This paper presents the results of theoretical studies using a number of different calculation tools, these including simple design calculations based on modifying a few current design methods and a commercial finite element package ABAQUS. The design methods considered in this paper include the British standard BS5950 Part 5, Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 and the American Specification AISI. Modifications of the current design equations are made to enable them to include distortional buckling, the effects of service holes and elevated temperatures. To enable BS5950 Part 5 and Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 to predict the ultimate strength of thin-walled columns with a service hole, the AISI (1996) design method is introduced. To extend the capacity of these design methods to deal with distortional buckling failure mode, the method of Young, Kwon and Hancock for calculating distortional buckling capacity is introduced in these codes. Finally, the ambient temperature design methods are modified to take into account changes in the strength and stiffness of steel at elevated temperatures. From extensive comparisons between the results of tests, code predictions and numerical analyses, it may be concluded that by adopting the aforementioned modifications, the current code design methods can be easily modified to consider these advanced modes of behaviour. For finite element analyses, both geometrical and material non-linearities are taken into account. The high temperature stress–strain relationships of steel are determined according to Eurocode 3, Part 1.2 or Outinen et al.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel-framed walls lined with appropriate sheathing materials are increasingly being used as vertical load bearing systems due to their many benefits. Despite this widespread use, attempts at improving their structural efficiency using either optimised studs or novel sheathing elements have been scarce. Arguably, the sustained use of lipped channel studs and conventional sheathing materials have long forestalled such improvements. Firstly, this study provides experimental evidence on the superior characteristics of the web-stiffened studs, developed specifically for load bearing steel-framed wall applications, and their ability to utilise sheathing restraints to achieve higher axial compression strengths. Secondly, it shows that the use of steel sheathing, either in isolation or together with gypsum plasterboards, significantly increases the strength of the web-stiffened stud. Thirdly, single plasterboard web-stiffened stud walls are found to be highly efficient due to the monolithic nature of the sheathing that leads to greater degrees of composite action between the studs and the sheathing. Finally, it presents a spring based analytical model capable of estimating the failure loads of sheathed web-stiffened studs conveniently. The model particularly focuses on the out-of-plane restraints provided by the sheathing, the contribution of which to the overall strength of the wall has traditionally been considered trivial, but is shown to be substantial in the case of web-stiffened studs. Using the improvements proposed, high capacity steel-framed load bearing walls can be developed with significant material and cost savings.},

The studied failure modes included the sectional yielding, interaction of local buckling and sectional yielding, interaction of local and global buckling, and global buckling. The finite element model was verified by experimental results from the ultimate strength, the failure modes and the failure deformation. Deformation shape along the column failed by different failure modes was presented. Stresses development at the middle span section was greatly affected by the failure modes. Ultimate strengths of a series of aluminum alloy columns with different length, cross section dimension were analyzed by the finite element analysis and current design codes at different temperatures in a fire. The current design codes greatly underestimated the ultimate strength of the thin-walled aluminum alloy column with irregular shaped cross section. Design method provided by EN1999-1-2 can give an accurate prediction of the ultimate strength of a short thin-walled aluminum alloy column with irregular shaped cross section at temperatures lower than 250 °C. A modification to the design method in EN1999-1-2 was proposed for predicting the ultimate strength of the aluminum alloy column with length longer than 500 mm and at temperatures higher than 250 °C. Ultimate strength predicted by the modified equation agreed well with finite element analysis results.},

abstract = {The structural fire behavior of typical load-bearing drywall systems, consisting of light cold-formed steel (CFS) studs, sheathed with single or double layers of gypsum plasterboards and air cavity or mineral wool insulation, is investigated. For that purpose, an efficient numerical modeling approach with satisfying accuracy is developed and validated against experimental and numerical results available in the literature. Heat transfer and structural analyses of the investigated drywall assemblies are carried out, employing the computational tools ANSYS CFX and ADINA, respectively. Transient heat transfer analyses provide the spatial and temporal temperature variation over the drywall assembly, which is assumed to be exposed to the standard ISO 834 fire curve from one side. Thermal simulation results are then introduced in the subsequent structural analyses, where the load-bearing capacity of the CFS studs under fire conditions is estimated, by means of Geometry and Material Nonlinear Analyses accounting for Imperfections (GMNIA). The load-bearing capacity assuming uniform cross-sectional temperature distributions is also evaluated and compared to the respective predictions under non-uniform temperature profiles. Results obtained by varying the imposed load or the applied temperature (fire duration), are compared to predictions of existing and literature-proposed fire design guidelines. EN 1993-1-2 provisions lead to average underestimation of the load-bearing capacity by approximately 20{\%}, while the literature-proposed methods are found to underestimate the load-bearing capacity by 5{\%} to 15{\%}. The limitation of using a critical temperature of 350°C for the structural fire design of thin-walled sections is found to be rather conservative, since the investigated CFS studs are able to exhibit satisfying fire performance also under higher temperature conditions.},

Owing to the assembly simplicity, materials' cheapness, high ecological standard, recycling, reuse potential, and other numerous advantages of such structures are widely employed in both office and residential buildings. The temperature of thin-walled structures increases rapidly as a consequence of the high section factor (measurement of the fire-exposed area to the heated volume), which creates the demand for a durable fire safety system, one of the fundamental requirements of the building safety. Although, several sufficient researches have been undertaken, there is still no strict performance-based fire design for cold-formed steel systems due to the lack of data. This paper compiles the existing works on the cold-formed thin-walled structures' fire performance, including numerical studies and experiments with mechanical and thermal properties of complete structures, purlins, joints (bolted, screwed, nailed, riveted etc.), plates, tubular structures, new calculation methods, new protective materials that are being used, such as intumescent coatings and etc.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel stud walls are a major component of Light Steel Framing (LSF) building systems used in commercial, industrial and residential buildings. In the conventional LSF stud wall systems, thin steel studs are protected from fire by placing one or two layers of plasterboard on both sides with or without cavity insulation. However, there is very limited data about the structural and thermal performance of stud wall systems while past research showed contradicting results, for example, about the benefits of cavity insulation. This research was therefore conducted to improve the knowledge and understanding of the structural and thermal performance of cold-formed steel stud wall systems (both load bearing and non-load bearing) under fire conditions and to develop new improved stud wall systems including reliable and simple methods to predict their fire resistance rating. Full scale fire tests of cold-formed steel stud wall systems formed the basis of this research. This research proposed an innovative LSF stud wall system in which a composite panel made of two plasterboards with insulation between them was used to improve the fire rating. Hence fire tests included both conventional steel stud walls with and without the use of cavity insulation and the new composite panel system. A propane fired gas furnace was specially designed and constructed first. The furnace was designed to deliver heat in accordance with the standard time temperature curve as proposed by AS 1530.4 (SA, 2005). A compression loading frame capable of loading the individual studs of a full scale steel stud wall system was also designed and built for the load-bearing tests. Fire tests included comprehensive time-temperature measurements across the thickness and along the length of all the specimens using K type thermocouples. They also included the measurements of load-deformation characteristics of stud walls until failure. The first phase of fire tests included 15 small scale fire tests of gypsum plasterboards, and composite panels using different types of insulating material of varying thickness and density. Fire performance of single and multiple layers of gypsum plasterboards was assessed including the effect of interfaces between adjacent plasterboards on the thermal performance. Effects of insulations such as glass fibre, rock fibre and cellulose fibre were also determined while the tests provided important data relating to the temperature at which the fall off of external plasterboards occurred. In the second phase, nine small scale non-load bearing wall specimens were tested to investigate the thermal performance of conventional and innovative steel stud wall systems. Effects of single and multiple layers of plasterboards with and without vertical joints were investigated. The new composite panels were seen to offer greater thermal protection to the studs in comparison to the conventional panels. In the third phase of fire tests, nine full scale load bearing wall specimens were tested to study the thermal and structural performance of the load bearing wall assemblies. A full scale test was also conducted at ambient temperature. These tests showed that the use of cavity insulation led to inferior fire performance of walls, and provided good explanations and supporting research data to overcome the incorrect industry assumptions about cavity insulation. They demonstrated that the use of insulation externally in a composite panel enhanced the thermal and structural performance of stud walls and increased their fire resistance rating significantly. Hence this research recommends the use of the new composite panel system for cold-formed LSF walls. This research also included steady state tensile tests at ambient and elevated temperatures to address the lack of reliable mechanical properties for high grade cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures. Suitable predictive equations were developed for calculating the yield strength and elastic modulus at elevated temperatures. In summary, this research has developed comprehensive experimental thermal and structural performance data for both the conventional and the proposed non-load bearing and load bearing stud wall systems under fire conditions. Idealized hot flange temperature profiles have been developed for non-insulated, cavity insulated and externally insulated load bearing wall models along with suitable equations for predicting their failure times. A graphical method has also been proposed to predict the failure times (fire rating) of non-load bearing and load bearing walls under different load ratios. The results from this research are useful to both fire researchers and engineers working in this field. Most importantly, this research has significantly improved the knowledge and understanding of cold-formed LSF walls under fire conditions, and developed an innovative LSF wall system with increased fire rating. It has clearly demonstrated the detrimental effects of using cavity insulation, and has paved the way for Australian building industries to develop new wall panels with increased fire rating for commercial applications worldwide.},

abstract = {Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) walls made of cold-formed steel stud and track sections and lined with gypsum plasterboards are commonly used in buildings as load bearing members. During fire events, gypsum plasterboards act as a thermal barrier and delay the temperature rise in the steel studs. Fire usually occurs on one side of LSF walls during which a non-uniform temperature distribution is developed across the steel stud cross-section. This results in thermal bowing deformations and non-uniform distribution of strength and stiffness within the studs. In most situations, fires are extinguished well before excessive or permanent plastic deformations of studs and/or stud failures occur. Hence the LSF wall frames could be re-used provided their residual capacities after fire events are adequate. This paper presents a study aimed at determining the residual compression capacities of LSF wall studs following fire exposure. A full scale standard fire test of LSF wall panel was conducted first, followed by a series of short column tests of lipped channel studs obtained from the tested LSF wall panel. Finite element analyses of the tested studs were undertaken using the measured post-fire mechanical properties of cold-formed steels. The residual compression capacities of these fire exposed short columns were also predicted using the ambient temperature cold-formed steel design rules. A numerical parametric study was then undertaken for 3m long studs in LSF wall panels with varying wall configurations following an exposure to standard fire. This paper presents the details of these experimental and numerical studies of fire exposed LSF wall panels and the results. It demonstrates the potential of re-using LSF wall frames following fire exposures and provides appropriate limits for fire exposure time and stud hot flange temperature for three commonly used LSF wall configurations.},

abstract = {Defining a methodology for measuring temperature in fire resistance furnaces is a challenge. This paper presents and discusses the performance of six different types of temperature sensors in wall and floor fire resistance furnaces namely: the ASTM E119 shielded thermocouples, ISO 834 plate thermometers, directional flame thermometers, bare-bead thermocouples, Inconel grounded and ungrounded sheathed thermocouples. The Inconel grounded and ungrounded sheathed thermocouples provided comparable results to those of the bear-bead thermocouples and are most suitable when a fast response time is desirable. Because of the fast response time and good durability, grounded and ungrounded junction thermocouples are well-suited for use in controlling the temperature in fire resistance standard test furnaces. The predicted and measured incident heat flux in furnaces controlled by either the bare-bead or grounded and ungrounded sheathed thermocouples are in good agreement.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {This paper presents the effect of plasterboard joints on the fire performance of cold-formed steel walls. Plasterboard joints are unavoidable. However, they can be arranged in a way that they do not significantly influence the fire performance of cold-formed steel walls. Hence a research study into the effects of plasterboard joints on the fire performance of plasterboard lined cold-formed steel walls was undertaken using both full-scale fire tests and numerical studies. In this study a back-blocking technique was used to eliminate the plasterboard joints being located over the studs. Instead plasterboard joints were used between studs with 150 mm wide plasterboards as back-blocks. Both experimental and numerical results from this study show that the fire resistance rating of single plasterboard lined cold-formed steel walls can be increased by 25{\%} through the use of a back-blocking joint arrangement in comparison to the traditional plasterboard joint arrangement over the studs.},

abstract = {The paper describes a series of tests on cold-formed channels with inclined simple edge stiffeners compressed between fixed ends. The simple edge stiffeners of the channel sections consist of simple lips. The new North American Specification and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures provide design rules for channels with inclined edge stiffeners. However, the design rules are mainly based on tests of sections having edge stiffeners perpendicular to the flanges. The provisions for inclined edge stiffeners are determined based on intuition without rigorous experimental evidence. Hence, it is important to obtain test data for sections with edge stiffeners not perpendicular to the flanges. A series of compression tests was performed on cold-formed channels with inclined edge stiffeners. The edge stiffeners of the channels were inclined at different angles for both outwards and inwards. The distortional buckling mode, where the flange and lip rotate about the flange-web junction restrained by the web, was observed in all tests. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths predicted by the North American Specification, the American Iron and Steel Institute Specification, and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. For the North American Specification and the American Iron and Steel Institute Specification, the distortional buckling mode is not explicitly accounted for in design. However, the Australian/New Zealand Standard has explicit design rules for distortional buckling in addition to the edge stiffened design rules which are the same as the American Iron and Steel Institute Specification.},

abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Light gauge steel-framed{\textless}/i{\textgreater} (LSF) walls are used as load bearing and non-load bearing building components in traditional concrete framed buildings and emerging all-steel structures. Recent building fire disasters around the world have highlighted the necessity for improved fire performance in such building components. While the fire performance of gypsum plasterboard, magnesium oxide board, calcium silicate board and {\textless}i{\textgreater}oriented strand board{\textless}/i{\textgreater} (OSB) sheathed LSF walls has been assessed using fire tests and numerical analyses in the past, fire performance of steel sheathed walls remains unknown. Steel sheathing can improve the in-plane shear capacity of steel framed walls and is an accepted lateral load carrying system with widespread applications in the cold-formed steel construction industry. This paper presents the results of a series of small-scale fire tests conducted on steel and gypsum plasterboard sheathed composite panels and framed walls, and also an enthalpy based analytical study using the experimental results. Provision of steel sheathing either only internally, only externally or both internally and externally in combination was found to enhance the fire performance of plasterboard panels and plasterboard framed walls. The confinement of water within plasterboards for a prolonged duration with the provision of steel sheathing was found to be the prime cause of this improvement. Furthermore, the formation of thermal bridges across the stud in cavity insulated walls was found to reduce the fire performance significantly.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel lipped channels are commonly used in LSF wall construction as load bearing studs with plasterboards on both sides. Under fire conditions, cold-formed thin-walled steel sections heat up quickly resulting in fast reduction in their strength and stiffness. Usually the LSF wall panels are subjected to fire from one side which will cause thermal bowing, neutral axis shift and magnification effects due to the development of non-uniform temperature distributions across the stud. This will induce an additional bending moment in the stud and hence the studs in LSF wall panels should be designed as a beam column considering both the applied axial compression load and the additional bending moment. Traditionally the fire resistance rating of these wall panels is based on approximate prescriptive methods. Very often they are limited to standard wall configurations used by the industry. Therefore a detailed research study is needed to develop fire design rules to predict the failure load and hence the failure time of LSF wall panels subject to non-uniform temperature distributions. This paper presents the details of an investigation to develop suitable fire design rules for LSF wall studs under non-uniform elevated temperature distributions. Applications of the previously developed fire design rules based on AISI design manual and Eurocode 3 Parts 1.2 and 1.3 to LSF wall studs were investigated in detail and new simplified fire design rules based on AS/NZS 4600 and Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 were proposed in the current study with suitable allowances for the interaction effects of compression and bending actions. The accuracy of the proposed fire design rules was verified by using the results from full scale fire tests and extensive numerical studies.},

abstract = {Fire design is an essential element of the overall design procedure of structural steel members and systems. Conventionally the fire rating of load-bearing stud wall systems made of light gauge steel frames (LSF) is based on approximate prescriptive methods developed on the basis of limited fire tests. This design is limited to standard wall configurations used by the industry. Increased fire rating is provided simply by adding more plasterboards to the stud walls. This is not an acceptable situation as it not only inhibits innovation and structural and cost efficiencies but also casts doubt over the fire safety of these light gauge steel stud wall systems. Hence a detailed fire research study into the performance and effectiveness of a recently developed innovative composite panel wall system was undertaken at Queensland University of Technology using both full scale fire tests and numerical studies. Experimental results of LSF walls using the new composite panels under axial compression load have shown the improvement in fire performance and fire resistance rating. Numerical analyses are currently being undertaken using the finite element program ABAQUS. Measured temperature profiles of the studs are used in the numerical models and the results are used to calibrate against full scale test results. The validated model will be used in a detailed parametric study with an aim to develop suitable design rules within the current cold-formed steel structures and fire design standards. This paper will present the results of experimental and numerical investigations into the structural and fire behaviour of light gauge steel stud walls protected by the new composite panel. It will demonstrate the improvements provided by the new composite panel system in comparison to traditional wall systems.},

One of the most important challenges opposing the sustainable development is the high housing costs along with the low-income strata's economic limitations, whereas according to the Millennium Development Goals, the governments are required to provide all the people with the housing. This paper is to emphasize on the role of new technologies like LSF to supply the economic and sustainable housing. The research main question is whether the utilization of LSF structures can reduce the construction costs and so enhance the possibility of housing ownership. And how is the situation for the case of Iran? To answer the research question, the base construction costs to construct a 75 square meter standard residential house with the conventional structures and the LSF structures are calculated separately. Then the construction costs of a 75 square meter standard residential house with two mentioned constructive methods in the cities of Qom, Kashan, Isfahan and Tehran as the research case-studies are estimated separately. The comparison of the conventional construction costs with the LSF costs shows that LSF technology reducing the construction costs plays the pivotal role in the control of housing shortage crisis and the increase of the house ownership's possibility and finally the housing sustainability.},

An infected host then proves the legitimacy of this key to a remote malware distribution platform, and receives and executes an encrypted payload in a way that prevents software visibility of the decrypted payload. We detail how malware can benefit from cloaked computations and discuss defenses against our protocol.

abstract = {Drywall is a widespread fire barrier used in house and general building construction. Drywall partitions and ceiling membranes are possibly the most common fire resistant construction approach employed in an extensive range of building types. The utilization of drywall board as prime fire protection of light-flame wood or steel construction is ubiquitous. Drywall board based systems are among those now broadly used, as walls or ceilings and it is principally employed as lining material in light-weight construction, which is a competent and cost effective technique of providing flexible partitioning assemblies in commercial and residential buildings. The thickness of the drywall board lining and the configuration of the framing can be flexibly changed to meet specified fire performance requirements. The use of such systems is increasing every day and there demands to be more research on their properties and behaviour. This paper will presents the properties of drywall board which will includes the assemblies and standard fire tests and the thermal properties of drywall in general and includes suggested properties of drywall by different researchers. Drywall boards shrink and crack at high temperatures, and this leads to collapse of parts of the drywall boards in fire. Fall-off of gypsum in fire affects the fire resistance of the assembly considerably, and cannot be overlooked when evaluating the fire resistance of drywall assemblies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Penerbit UTM Press.

The vehicle body temperature profile from the heat transfer analysis is applied as an input for a structural analysis to predict buckling. This study is focused on the radiant section of the curing ovens. The radiant section of the oven has the largest temperature gradients within the body structure. This methodology couples a fully transient thermal analysis to simulate the structure through the electro-coat and paint curing environments with a structural, buckling analysis. The ability to predict the buckling phenomenon using a virtual simulation will reduce the risk of late production changes to the vehicle class "A" surfaces.

abstract = {Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) walls are commonly used in building construction. In general, they are lined with single or double layers of gypsum plasterboards with and without cavity insulation. Gypsum plasterboards act as a thermal barrier to protect the thin-walled steel studs from rapid temperature rise. In these walls, plasterboard joints are located along the studs for ease of construction and are protected by filler materials. During fires, these plasterboard joints crack and open up, and thus allow the stud temperatures to rise rapidly and initiate premature structural failures in LSF walls. This research investigated the detrimental effects of these plasterboards joints on the fire resistance rating of single and double plasterboard lined walls based on the hot flange time-temperature profiles of studs from full scale fire tests. To overcome the detrimental effects of plasterboard joints, the back-blocking technique was used, where plasterboard joints were placed between studs with 150 mm wide plasterboards as back-blocks. Full scale fire tests and numerical studies were performed on single plasterboard lined load bearing LSF wall panels to investigate the improved fire performance by using this technique. They showed that the fire resistance rating of these LSF walls was increased by 25{\%} in comparison to the conventional plasterboard joint arrangement over the studs. This paper presents the details of this research on the detrimental effects of plasterboard joints on the fire resistance of load bearing LSF walls, and the results. It also includes a discussion and results for non-load bearing LSF walls.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel beams are increasingly used as floor joists and bearers in buildings and often their behaviour and moment capacities are influenced by lateral-torsional buckling. With increasing usage of cold-formed steel beams their fire safety design has become an important issue. Fire design rules are commonly based on past research on hot-rolled steel beams. Hence a detailed parametric study was undertaken using validated finite element models to investigate the lateral-torsional buckling behaviour of simply supported cold-formed steel lipped channel beams subjected to uniform bending at uniform elevated temperatures. The moment capacity results were compared with the predictions from the available ambient temperature and fire design rules and suitable recommendations were made. European fire design rules were found to be over-conservative while the ambient temperature design rules could not be used based on single buckling curve. Hence a new design method was proposed that includes the important non-linear stress-strain characteristics observed for cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures. Comparison with numerical moment capacities demonstrated the accuracy of the new design method. This paper presents the details of the parametric study, comparisons with current design rules and the new design rules proposed in this research for lateral-torsional buckling of cold-formed steel lipped channel beams at elevated temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Fire dynamics simulator (FDS) is a computational fluid dynamics code, developed by NIST for fire related simulations. In recent years, there has been an increase in use of FDS for performance-based analysis in the area of structural fire research. This paper discusses the FDS–finite element method (FEM) simulation methodology for structural fire analysis. The general methodology is described and a validation study is presented. A data element used to transfer data from FDS to FEM codes, the adiabatic surface temperature, is discussed. A tool named fire-thermomechanical interface is applied to transfer data from FDS to ANSYS. A high temperature stress–strain model for structural steel developed by NIST is included in the FEM analysis. Compared to experimental results, the FDS–FEM method predicted both the thermal and structural responses of a steel column in a localized fire test. The column buckling time was predicted with a maximum error of 7.8{\%}. Based on these results, this methodology has potential to be used in performance-based analysis.},

Integrated fire-structure simulation method is required to accurately predict the response of structures in realistic fires (e.g. localized fires). In recent years, there is an increase in use of FDS (Fire Dynamics Simulator) - FEM (finite element method) approach for performance-based structural fire design. This paper discusses the FDS-FEM approach for predicting the thermal response of structures subjected to localized fires. A fire-structure interface, named adiabatic surface temperature (AST), was applied to transfer data from FDS to ANSYS. By comparing the predicted and measured heat fluxes and steel temperatures of a steel ceiling beam exposed to a localized fire condition, the FDS-FEM method was tested. The FDS predicted heat fluxes matched well with the test data. The difference between the predicted and measured maximum heat fluxes was within 6{\%} for the investigated two cases. The FDS-FEM method gave good prediction of the steel temperatures. The over-prediction of maximum steel temperature was within 11{\%} for the investigated case. The methods described in this study provide a feasible way to study the complex behavior of structures in realistic fires.},

@article{Gunalan2011,
abstract = {In recent times, light gauge steel framed (LSF) structures, such as cold-formed steel wall systems, are increasingly used, but without a full understanding of their fire performance. Traditionally the fire resistance rating of these load-bearing LSF wall systems is based on approximate prescriptive methods developed based on limited fire tests. Very often they are limited to standard wall configurations used by the industry. Increased fire rating is provided simply by adding more plasterboards to these walls. This is not an acceptable situation as it not only inhibits innovation and structural and cost efficiencies but also casts doubt over the fire safety of these wall systems. Hence a detailed fire research study into the performance of LSF wall systems was undertaken using full scale fire tests and extensive numerical studies. A new composite wall panel developed at QUT was also considered in this study, where the insulation was used externally between the plasterboards on both sides of the steel wall frame instead of locating it in the cavity. Three full scale fire tests of LSF wall systems built using the new composite panel system were undertaken at a higher load ratio using a gas furnace designed to deliver heat in accordance with the standard time temperature curve in AS 1530.4 (SA, 2005). Fire tests included the measurements of load-deformation characteristics of LSF walls until failure as well as associated time-temperature measurements across the thickness and along the length of all the specimens. Tests of LSF walls under axial compression load have shown the improvement to their fire performance and fire resistance rating when the new composite panel was used. Hence this research recommends the use of the new composite panel system for cold-formed LSF walls. The numerical study was undertaken using a finite element program ABAQUS. The finite element analyses were conducted under both steady state and transient state conditions using the measured hot and cold flange temperature distributions from the fire tests. The elevated temperature reduction factors for mechanical properties were based on the equations proposed by Dolamune Kankanamge and Mahendran (2011). These finite element models were first validated by comparing their results with experimental test results from this study and Kolarkar (2010). The developed finite element models were able to predict the failure times within 5 minutes. The validated model was then used in a detailed numerical study into the strength of cold-formed thin-walled steel channels used in both the conventional and the new composite panel systems to increase the understanding of their behaviour under nonuniform elevated temperature conditions and to develop fire design rules. The measured time-temperature distributions obtained from the fire tests were used. Since the fire tests showed that the plasterboards provided sufficient lateral restraint until the failure of LSF wall panels, this assumption was also used in the analyses and was further validated by comparison with experimental results. Hence in this study of LSF wall studs, only the flexural buckling about the major axis and local buckling were considered. A new fire design method was proposed using AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005), NAS (AISI, 2007) and Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 (ECS, 2006). The importance of considering thermal bowing, magnified thermal bowing and neutral axis shift in the fire design was also investigated. A spread sheet based design tool was developed based on the above design codes to predict the failure load ratio versus time and temperature for varying LSF wall configurations including insulations. Idealised time-temperature profiles were developed based on the measured temperature values of the studs. This was used in a detailed numerical study to fully understand the structural behaviour of LSF wall panels. Appropriate equations were proposed to find the critical temperatures for different composite panels, varying in steel thickness, steel grade and screw spacing for any load ratio. Hence useful and simple design rules were proposed based on the current cold-formed steel structures and fire design standards, and their accuracy and advantages were discussed. The results were also used to validate the fire design rules developed based on AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) and Eurocode Part 1.3 (ECS, 2006). This demonstrated the significant improvements to the design method when compared to the currently used prescriptive design methods for LSF wall systems under fire conditions. In summary, this research has developed comprehensive experimental and numerical thermal and structural performance data for both the conventional and the proposed new load bearing LSF wall systems under standard fire conditions. Finite element models were developed to predict the failure times of LSF walls accurately. Idealized hot flange temperature profiles were developed for non-insulated, cavity and externally insulated load bearing wall systems. Suitable fire design rules and spread sheet based design tools were developed based on the existing standards to predict the ultimate failure load, failure times and failure temperatures of LSF wall studs. Simplified equations were proposed to find the critical temperatures for varying wall panel configurations and load ratios. The results from this research are useful to both structural and fire engineers and researchers. Most importantly, this research has significantly improved the knowledge and understanding of cold-formed LSF loadbearing walls under standard fire conditions.},

The dynamic response of this system under seismic actions is analysed by performing shake table tests on two reduced-scale (1:3) three-storey two-bay prototypes, that differed in floor typology: steel–concrete floors (Type 1) or floors made of wood-based panels (Type 2). Main outcomes show that the seismic response can be considered as satisfactory, because the system seems to have inherent ductility even without a designated energy dissipating mechanism. In particular, the seismic response was approximately linear for tests having intensity not greater than that assumed for the design, whereas for tests having higher intensities the behaviour deviated from the linearity, with maximum interstorey drift angles greater than 2{\%} without very extensive damage, and in-plane floor rigid behaviour for both prototypes according to the ASCE 7 definition.},

abstract = {Fire safety of light gauge steel frame (LSF) stud walls is important in the design of buildings. Currently LSF walls are increasingly used in the building industry, and are usually made of cold-formed and thin-walled steel studs that are fire-protected by two layers of plasterboard on both sides. Many experimental and numerical studies have been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of load bearing LSF walls under standard fire conditions. However, the standard time-temperature curve does not represent the fire load present in typical residential and commercial buildings that include considerable amount of thermoplastic materials. Real building fires are unlikely to follow a standard time-temperature curve. However, only limited research has been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of load bearing LSF walls under realistic design fire conditions. Therefore in this research, finite element thermal models of the traditional LSF wall panels without cavity insulation and the new LSF composite wall panels were developed to simulate their fire performance under recently developed realistic design fire curves. Suitable thermal properties were proposed for plasterboards and insulations based on laboratory tests and literature review. The developed models were then validated by comparing their thermal performance results with available results from realistic design fire tests, and were later used in parametric studies. This paper presents the details of the developed finite element thermal models of load bearing LSF wall panels under realistic design fire time-temperature curves and the re-sults. It shows that finite element thermal models can be used to predict the fire performance of load bearing LSF walls with varying configurations of insulations and plasterboards under realistic design fires. Failure times of load bearing LSF walls were also predicted based on the results from finite element thermal analyses.},

abstract = {Fire safety design is important to eliminate the loss of property and lives during fire events. Gypsum plasterboard is widely used as a fire safety material in the building industry all over the world. It contains gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) and Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) and most importantly free and chemically bound water in its crystal structure. The dehydration of the gypsum and the decomposition of Calcium Carbonate absorb heat, which gives the gypsum plasterboard fire resistant qualities. Currently plasterboard manufacturers use additives such as vermiculite to overcome shrinkage of gypsum core and glass fibre to bridge shrinkage cracks and enhance the integrity of board during calcination and after the loss of paper facings in fires. Past research has also attempted to reduce the thermal conductivity of plasterboards using fillers. However, no research has been undertaken to enhance the specific heat of plasterboard and the points of dehydration using chemical additives and fillers. Hence detailed experimental studies of powdered samples of plasterboard mixed with chemical additives and fillers in varying proportions were conducted. These tests showed the enhancement of specific heat of plasterboard. Numerical models were also developed to investigate the thermal performance of enhanced plasterboards under standard fire conditions. The results showed that the use of these enhanced plasterboards in steel wall systems can significantly improve their fire performance. This paper presents the details of this research and the results that can be used to enhance the fire safety of steel wall systems commonly used in buildings.},

abstract = {Seismic damage of non-structural components could involve functionality interruption of the most affected buildings and substantial economic losses. Among non-structural components, the ceiling-partition wall systems represent a significant investment in the construction sector. Nevertheless, the seismic design of these systems plays a secondary role within the structural design, by leading to a lack of specific design provisions. Because the behaviour of these systems cannot be easily simulated with traditional analysis methods, the experimental characterization is an effective procedure. For these reasons, an important collaboration between an international company and the University of Naples Federico II was established over the last few years. The main objective of the research is to investigate the seismic performance of non-structural lightweight steel drywall building components, i.e. partition walls and suspended continuous ceilings made of lightweight steel profiles and sheathed with gypsum-based panels. The presented paper describes and discusses particularly the out-of-plane quasi-static monotonic tests and dynamic identification tests carried out on lightweight steel drywall partition walls, mainly devoted to develop the seismic design criteria by testing of these systems.},

It was found that heat transfer did not always decrease monotonously with an increase of aspect (depth-width) ratio D/W, in the flow range of laminar to turbulent. Correlations between Num and Rew were made in laminar and turbulent heat transfer ranges. {\textcopyright} 1979 by ASME.},

abstract = {Current design rules for the member capacities of cold-formed steel columns are based on the same non-dimensional strength curve for both fixed and pinned-ended columns at ambient temperature. This research has investigated the accuracy of using current ambient temperature design rules in Australia/New Zealand (AS/NZS 4600), American (AISI S100) and European (Eurocode 3 Part 1.3) standards in determining the flexural–torsional buckling capacities of cold-formed steel columns at uniform elevated temperatures using appropriately reduced mechanical properties. It was found that these design rules accurately predicted the member capacities of pin ended lipped channel columns undergoing flexural torsional buckling at elevated temperatures. However, for fixed ended columns with warping fixity undergoing flexural–torsional buckling, the current design rules significantly underestimated the column capacities as they disregard the beneficial effect of warping fixity. This paper has therefore recommended the use of improved design rules developed for ambient temperature conditions to predict the axial compression capacities of fixed ended columns subject to flexural–torsional buckling at elevated temperatures within AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S100 design provisions. The accuracy of the proposed fire design rules was verified using finite element analysis and test results of cold-formed lipped channel columns at elevated temperatures except for low strength steel columns with intermediate slenderness whose behaviour was influenced by the increased nonlinearity in the stress–strain curves at elevated temperatures. Further research is required to include these effects within AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S100 design rules. However, Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 design rules can be used for this purpose by using suitable buckling curves as recommended in this paper.},

abstract = {Light steel frame (LSF) building systems are becoming more prevalent in commercial, industrial and residential construction in New Zealand. Tested fire resistance ratings are generally available for non-loadbearing LSF drywall systems lined with gypsum plasterboard. No test information exists for loadbearing systems. Current solutions are based on limiting steel temperature. This study investigates the parameters which affect the performance of loadbearing LSF drywall systems exposed to fire. Structural design codes for cold-formed steel members are compared. Methods are presented for calculating the reduction of steel strength and stiffness at elevated temperatures, and for predicting the deformations resulting from temperature gradients and P-∆ effects. Heat transfer modelling by computer is used to predict steel framing temperatures for systems exposed to the standard ISO834 time-temperature curve and real fires. Three full-scale furnace tests were carried out to evaluate analytical predictions. A model is proposed for predicting the performance of loadbearing LSF systems exposed to fire. Results are within 80-90{\%} of test results. The current practice of designing to a limiting steel temperature results in unduly conservative predictions, particularly for systems with low applied axial loads. It was also found that fire tests may give non-conservative results for systems with low stud loads due to frictional restraints.},

However, the structural behaviour of thin-walled cold-formed steel columns under fire conditions is not well understood despite the increasing use of light gauge steels in building construction. Cold-formed steel columns are often subject to local buckling effects. Therefore a series of laboratory tests of lipped and unlipped channel columns made of varying steel thicknesses and grades was undertaken at uniform elevated temperatures up to 700°C under steady state conditions. Finite element models of the tested columns were also developed, and their elastic buckling and nonlinear analysis results were compared with test results at elevated temperatures. Effects of the degradation of mechanical properties of steel with temperature were included in the finite element analyses. The use of accurately measured yield stress, elasticity modulus and stress-strain curves at elevated temperatures provided a good comparison of the ultimate loads and load-deflection curves from tests and finite element analyses. The commonly used effective width design rules and the direct strength method at ambient temperature were then used to predict the ultimate loads at elevated temperatures by using the reduced mechanical properties. By comparing these predicted ultimate loads with those from tests and finite element analyses, the accuracy of using this design approach was evaluated.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a hybrid numerical-experimental method for extracting thermal conductivity of various gypsum board products at elevated temperatures. Gypsum board is ubiquitously used in fire resistant construction, yet there is wide variability in reported values of thermal conductivity of gypsum at high temperatures. Given the effects of porosity, moisture and non-linear temperature distribution in gypsum under heating, direct measurement of thermal conductivity, e.g. by using the hot plate method, is not an easy task. This paper proposes a thermal conductivity model for gypsum at high temperatures, treating gypsum as a porous material consisting of solid and pores and takes into consideration the effects of radiation at high temperatures. This enables the gypsum thermal conductivity-temperature relationship to be described as a function of two variables: reduction in thermal conductivity from its value at ambient temperature to that of dried gypsum, and effective spherical void size. To enable these two parameters to be quantified, a hybrid experimental-numerical method is proposed. This hybrid model uses a validated one-dimensional Finite Difference heat conduction program and high temperature test results on small samples of gypsum boards. Through a clearly defined trial and error procedure, the water evaporation induced drop in the thermal conductivity, and the void size that gives the best agreement between numerical prediction and high temperature tests are obtained to quantify the gypsum thermal conductivity-temperature relationship. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents and discusses the performance of six different types of temperature sensors in wall and floor fire resistance furnaces namely: the ASTM E119 shielded thermocouples, ISO 834 plate thermometers, directional flame thermometers, bare-bead thermocouples, Inconel grounded and ungrounded sheathed thermocouples. The Inconel grounded and ungrounded sheathed thermocouples provided comparable results to those of the bear-bead thermocouples and are most suitable when a fast response time is desirable. Because of the fast response time and good durability, grounded and ungrounded junction thermocouples are well-suited for use in controlling the temperature in fire resistance standard test furnaces. The predicted and measured incident heat flux in furnaces controlled by either the bare-bead or grounded and ungrounded sheathed thermocouples are in good agreement. {\textcopyright} 2010 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.},

abstract = {Cold-formed thin-walled steel sections are usually used as the load-bearing elements of wall panels in building construction. Such panels consist of channel steel sections with gypsum plasterboard layers attached to the flanges on the outside and interior insulation. This paper proposes a simple method to calculate temperature distributions in the steel section when the panel is exposed to fire from one side. This method calculates the average temperatures in the flanges of the steel section and assumes that the temperature in the web is linear. The proposed method is based on simple heat balance analysis for a few nodes representing the key components of the panel. The thermal resistance of these nodes is obtained from the weighted average of thermal resistances in an effective width of the panel within which heat transfer in the panel width direction is assumed to occur. The effective width of the panel for calculating the weighted average of thermal resistances can be taken as the steel section flange width plus 15{\%} of the difference between 300 mm and the flange width of the steel section. Validity of the proposed method has been checked by comparison of the temperature results between the proposed 1-D modelling and 2-D ABAQUS Finite Element modelling for an extensive set of parametric and sensitivity studies covering different steel section dimensions (width, depth, thickness and lips), different spacing between steel section, number of gypsum layers (1 or 2) and different interior insulation properties. Further assessment of accuracy of the proposed temperature calculation method has been provided by comparing compressive resistance of the steel studs between using temperature profiles produced by 2-D ABAQUS Finite Element simulation and by using the proposed simplified method. Although the simplified method still requires a numerical procedure, it is extremely easy to implement to give designers of this structural system a much more efficient tool than using Finite Element simulations to calculate its fire resistance.},

This report describes a software tool for predicting the likely fire resistance performance of a non-loadbearing or loadbearing wall subjected to a standard fire resistance test, or when subjected to real fire conditions. Prediction of the performance of fire barriers in this study employed finite difference techniques for heat conduction within linings and also for convection and radiation on the boundaries and cavity. A user-friendly interface was developed for input of the parameters from the lining properties and dimensions, stud sizes, wall height and whether the studs are timber or steel. A choice of fire exposure is also permitted so that 'a standard ISO curve' or 'real fire with a decay period' may be input by the user. Algorithms for the charring of timber and reduction of steel strength and stiffness at elevated temperatures are included to determine a structural failure condition for the studs.},

abstract = {Light Gauge Steel Framing (LSF) walls made of cold-formed and thin-walled steel lipped channel studs with plasterboard linings on both sides are commonly used in commercial, industrial and residential buildings. However, there is limited data about their structural and thermal performance under fire conditions while past research showed contradicting results about the benefits of using cavity insulation. A new composite wall panel was recently proposed to improve the fire resistance rating of LSF walls, where an insulation layer was used externally between the plasterboards on both sides of the wall frame instead of using it in the cavity. In this research 11 full scale tests were conducted on conventional load bearing steel stud walls with and without cavity insulation, and the new composite panel system to study their thermal and structural performance under standard fire conditions. These tests showed that the use of cavity insulation led to inferior fire performance of walls, and provided supporting research data. They demonstrated that the use of insulation externally in a composite panel enhanced the thermal and structural performance of LSF walls and increased their fire resistance rating. This paper presents the details of the LSF wall tests and the thermal and structural performance data and fire resistance rating of load-bearing wall assemblies lined with varying plasterboard-insulation configurations under two different load ratios. Fire test results including the time–temperature and deflection profiles are presented along with the failure times and modes.},

This research was aimed at developing simple design rules to predict the failure times (fire resistance) of LSF floors made of lipped channel section joists exposed to standard fires. The use of ambient temperature section modulus led to over-estimation of the moment capacity as the mechanical properties of steel varied across the joist cross-section while deteriorating with increasing joist temperatures in fires.

abstract = {The performance of gypsum plasterboard assemblies is typically evaluated in accordance with standardised test methods such as BS476, AS1530 or ASTM E119. Standard time-temperature curves give good comparison between tested materials. However, they are generally less severe than a typical short duration compartment fire, they do not have a decay phase, and may be conservative for long duration fires. It is not common knowledge that test time-temperature relationships, such as ISO834, have not significantly changed since they were originally formulated in the early 1930's. Full-scale compartment testing based on typical residential scenarios conducted as part of this study, revealed that temperatures within a compartment can far exceed those of standard time-temperature curves within several minutes of ignition. Pilot-scale furnace testing to non-standard time-temperature curves has revealed that the performance of light framed gypsum plasterboard assemblies is highly dependent on the severity of the fire exposure. A system that has achieved a fire resistance rating of 60 minutes failed within 30 minutes to a fire exposure that would represent a moderate compartment fire. Current fire engineering designs often use sophisticated evacuation models to calculate minimum escape times required for safe evacuation of occupants. These evacuation times typically fall in the range from 15 - 60 minutes. The suitability of protecting escape routes using barriers rated against a standard fire test is questioned. SAPIR, a powerful finite element program, has been employed to predict the thermal behaviour of various gypsum plasterboard assemblies exposed to a range of nonstandard fires. Results from the computer modelling are compared with several full and pilot scale furnace tests. It was found that the model calibrated to results from standard ISO834 furnace testing provided reasonable predictions of temperatures within assemblies exposed to a moderate fire. Temperature predictions of assemblies exposed to severe fires were poor.},

abstract = {Recently unclassified boards with varying composition and more notably with ambiguous thermal properties are being used in buildings. The fire performance of Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems mainly depends on the protective plasterboard linings used and thus fire safety concerns are being raised. Therefore this study was aimed at setting minimum standards for fire-resistant grade plasterboards used in LSF wall applications based on material characterization, thermo-physical properties and finite element heat transfer modelling. The most commonly used fire protective board, gypsum plasterboard was used to address this critical issue. Thermo-physical properties of three gypsum plasterboards manufactured in Australia were measured and compared in relation to their chemical composition in the first phase of the study. Fire resistance levels (FRLs) of LSF wall systems lined with these three plasterboards were determined using 3-D FE heat transfer models of LSF wall systems developed and validated in this study. The paper proposes a “k-factor” based on thermo-physical properties and thickness of plasterboard, capable of giving an overall measure of the fire performance of plasterboard lined LSF walls. Standard k-factor profiles were established for non-load bearing LSF wall systems with FRLs of 60, 120, 180 and 240 min by considering the correlation between the time-temperature profiles from numerical analyses and calculated k-factors. These proposed standard k-factor profiles give an overall measure of the fire performance of plasterboards. This paper presents the details of this study and the results.},

abstract = {A nonlinear finite element (FE) model is developed to simulate two series of flexural tests, previously conducted by the authors, on industry standard cold-formed steel C- and Z-section beams. The previous tests focused on laterally braced beams with compression flange details that lead predominately to local buckling failures, in the first test series, and distortional buckling failures, in the second test series. The objectives of this paper are to (i) validate the FE model developed for simulation of the testing, (ii) perform parametric studies outside the bounds of the original tests with a particular focus on variation in yield stress and influence of moment gradient on failures, and (iii) apply the study results to examine and extend the Direct Strength Method of design. The developed FE model shows good agreement with the test data in terms of ultimate bending strength. Extension of the tested sections to cover yield stresses from 228 to 506 MPa indicates that the Direct Strength Method is applicable over this full range of yield stresses. The FE model is also applied to analyze the effect of moment gradient on distortional buckling. It is found that the distortional buckling strength of beams is increased due to the presence of moment gradient. Further, it is proposed and verified that the moment gradient effect on distortional buckling failures can be conservatively accounted for in the Direct Strength Method by using an elastic buckling moment that accounts for the moment gradient. An empirical equation, appropriate for use in design, to predict the increase in the elastic distortional buckling moment due to moment gradient, is developed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The stability and strength of cold-formed steel lipped C-section columns (studs) with sheathing attached to the flanges is the subject of this paper. Stud configurations both with and without sheathing, either oriented strand board or gypsum board, are tested for failure in compression. A total of twenty-six tests covering short, intermediate and long specimens, varied sheathing configurations, and varied end boundary conditions are completed. Dimensions and geometric imperfections of the specimens are measured in detail. The measured geometric imperfections are reduced to scalar magnitudes consistent with local, distortional, and global buckling modes. During the testing, mid-height cross-section deformations are recorded using five position transducers. The deformations indicate the impact of the different combinations of sheathing, and of the end boundary conditions, on the strength and stability of the studs. Composite action between the stud and sheathing, and isolating direct loading of the sheathing, are shown to be significant in determining the strength and controlling limit state of the stud. Tested strengths are compared with existing North American (American Iron and Steel Institute) specification methods and potential improvements are explored. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to provide the theoretical background and illustrate the capabilities of the constrained finite strip method (cFSM) for thin-walled members with general end boundary conditions. Based on the conventional finite strip method (FSM), cFSM provides a mechanical methodology to separate the deformations of a thin-walled member into those consistent with global, distortional, local, and other (e.g., shear and transverse extension) modes. For elastic buckling analysis, this enables isolation of any given mode (modal decomposition) or quantitative measures of the interactions within a given general eigenmode (modal identification). Existing cFSM is only applicable to simply supported end boundary conditions. In this paper, FSM is first extended to general end boundary conditions, including simply- simply, clamped-clamped, simply-clamped, clamped-guided, and clamped-free. Next, with the conventional FSM for general end boundary conditions in place, the derivation of the constraint matrices for global, distortional, local, and other modes that play a central role in cFSM are summarized. Several bases (i.e., the constraint matrices) are presented for general end boundary conditions involving, in particular, different orthogonalization conditions. For modal identification, normalization schemes for the base vectors as well as the summation method employed for the modal participation calculation are also provided. Numerical examples of modal decomposition and identification are illustrated for a thin-walled member with general end boundary conditions. Recommendations on the choice of basis, orthogonalization, and normalization are provided. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Therefore, a research project based on detailed experimental studies was undertaken to investigate the distortional buckling behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel compression members under simulated fire conditions.

Both low (G250) and high (G550) strength steels were used. Distortional buckling tests were conducted at six different temperatures in the range of 20–800 ∘C. The ultimate loads of compression members subject to distortional buckling were then used to review the adequacy of the current design rules at ambient and elevated temperatures.

abstract = {Fire safety design of building structures has received greater attention in recent times due to continuing loss of properties and lives during fires. However, fire performance of light gauge cold-formed steel structures is not well understood despite its increased usage in buildings. Cold-formed steel compression members are susceptible to various buckling modes such as local and distortional buckling and their ultimate strength behaviour is governed by these buckling modes. Therefore a research project based on experimental and numerical studies was undertaken to investigate the distortional buckling behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel compression members under simulated fire conditions. Lipped channel sections with and without additional lips were selected with three thicknesses of 0.6, 0.8, and 0.95 mm and both low and high strength steels (G250 and G550 steels). More than 150 compression tests were undertaken first at ambient and elevated temperatures. Finite element models of the tested compression members were then developed by including the degradation of mechanical properties with increasing temperatures. Comparison of finite element analysis and experimental results showed that the developed finite element models were capable of simulating the distortional buckling and strength behaviour at ambient and elevated temperatures up to 800 °C. The validated model was used to determine the effects of mechanical properties, geometric imperfections and residual stresses on the distortional buckling behaviour and strength of cold-formed steel columns. This paper presents the details of the numerical study and the results. It demonstrated the importance of using accurate mechanical properties at elevated temperatures in order to obtain reliable strength characteristics of cold-formed steel columns under fire conditions.},

abstract = {Most previous fire experiments of cold-formed steel (CFS) walls focused on ISO 834 fire. The corresponding results may not represent the actual fire performance of CFS walls in some special circumstances. This paper presents a full-scale experimental investigation of gypsum-sheathed cavity-insulated CFS walls under four different fire conditions. The results show that the axial load has an insignificant effect on the heat transfer of such walls in fire. This realization provides a basis for the indirect coupling method of thermal-mechanical analysis of CFS walls, in which the time-temperature profiles of non-load-bearing CFS walls are adopted in the thermal-mechanical analysis of load-bearing walls. In addition, for CFS walls with the same configuration and load level, different fire conditions do not change the failure mode of steel studs; in particular, the stud hot flanges exhibit almost the same temperature when the structural failure of CFS walls occurs. Hence, a new time equivalency method of CFS walls is proposed, which uses the same temperature of hot flange as the principle of equivalency. Meanwhile, both the equal area method and energy-based method are modified by using reference temperatures, and give a good prediction of the fire resistance time equivalency of CFS walls. Moreover, significant opening of gypsum board joints is observed during the fire exposure; however, this phenomenon is an inherent characteristic of heated gypsum boards and has insignificant correlation with the out-of-plane deflection of CFS walls. Furthermore, staggered board joints are recommended as an important and effective fire resistance configuration of CFS walls.},

abstract = {Light gauge steel frame wall systems are commonly used in industrial and commercial buildings, and there is a need for simple fire design rules to predict their load capacities and fire resistance ratings. During fire events, the light gauge steel frame wall studs are subjected to non-uniform temperature distributions that cause thermal bowing, neutral axis shift and magnification effects and thus resulting in a combined axial compression and bending action on the studs. In this research, a series of full-scale fire tests was conducted first to evaluate the performance of light gauge steel frame wall systems with eight different wall configurations under standard fire conditions. Finite element models of light gauge steel frame walls were then developed, analysed under transient and steady-state conditions and validated using full-scale fire tests. Using the results from fire tests and finite element analyses, a detailed investigation was undertaken into the prediction of axial compression strength and failure times of light gauge steel frame wall studs in standard fires using the available fire design rules based on Australian, American and European standards. The results from both fire tests and finite element analyses were used to investigate the ability of these fire design rules to include the complex effects of non-uniform temperature distributions and their accuracy in predicting the axial compression strength of wall studs and the failure times. Suitable modifications were then proposed to the fire design rules.

abstract = {The paper considers a fully coupled thermo-mechanical analysis of one-layered and multilayered isotropic and composite plates. In the proposed analysis, the temperature is considered a primary variable as the displacement; it is therefore directly obtained from the model and this feature permits the temperature field to be evaluated through the thickness direction in three different cases: - static analysis with imposed temperature on the external surfaces; - static analysis of structures subjected to a mechanical load, with the possibility of considering the temperature field effects; - a free vibration problem, with the evaluation of the temperature field effects. In the first case, imposing a temperature at the top and bottom of the plate, the static response is given in term of displacements, stresses and temperature field; the proposed method is very promising if compared to a partially coupled thermo-mechanical analysis, where the temperature is only considered as an external load, and the temperature profile must be a priori defined: considering it linear through the thickness direction or calculating it by solving the Fourier heat conduction equation. In the second case, a mechanical load is applied. The fully coupled thermo-mechanical analysis gives smaller displacement values than those obtained with the pure mechanical analysis; the temperature effect is not considered in this latter approach. The third case is the free vibration problem. The fully coupled thermo-mechanical analysis permits the effect of the temperature field to be evaluated: larger frequencies are obtained with respect to the pure mechanical analysis. Carrera's Unified Formulation is applied to obtain several refined models with orders of expansion in the thickness direction, from linear to fourth-order, for displacements and temperature. Both equivalent single layer and layer wise approaches are considered for the multilayered plates. At present, no benchmarks are available within the framework of a fully coupled theory. This work aims to fill this gap. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Coupled CFD fire simulations and thermomechanical FE analyses typically consist of fire simulations, heat transfer analyses and structural response analyses, mutually coupled by three coupling steps. There are two coupling approaches, one-way and two-way coupling, where two-way coupling includes the effects of the structural response on fire propagation. In the first part of this paper, one- and two-way coupling approaches including the coupling steps are proposed to include coupling at the structural level. Then a case study comprising an office space with a 12-plate thin-walled steel fa{\c{c}}ade under fire conditions is introduced, as well as the related CFD and FE models. A newly developed automated coupling interface and subprograms are used to perform several one-way and two-way coupled analyses using a coarse and fine CFD mesh for the case study. Slight differences are found in the results of identical simulations due to random effects in the fire simulations. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that two-way coupling is feasible, and that significant differences in the fa{\c{c}}ade failure progression illustrate its effectiveness. Future research includes additional developments of both the fire and structural models, as well as verification and parametric studies to further confirm the findings.},

abstract = {This paper presents the mechanical properties data for cold-formed steel at elevated temperatures. The deterioration of the mechanical properties of yield strength (0.2{\%} proof stress) and elastic modulus are the primary properties in the design and analysis of cold-formed steel structures under fire. However, values of these properties at different temperatures are not well reported. Therefore, both steady and transient tensile coupon tests were conducted at different temperatures ranged approximately from 20 to 1000 °C for obtaining the mechanical properties of cold-formed steel structural material. This study included cold-formed steel grades G550 and G450 with plate thickness of 1.0 and 1.9 mm, respectively. Curves of elastic modulus, yield strength obtained at different strain levels, ultimate strength, ultimate strain and thermal elongation versus different temperatures are plotted and compared with the results obtained from the Australian, British, European standards and the test results predicted by other researchers. A unified equation for yield strength, elastic modulus, ultimate strength and ultimate strain of cold-formed steel at elevated temperatures is proposed in this paper. A full strain range expression up to the ultimate tensile strain for the stress–strain curves of cold-formed carbon steel at elevated temperatures is also proposed in this paper. It is shown that the proposed equation accurately predicted the test results.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) walls are extensively used in the building industry due to the many advantages they provide over other wall systems. Although LSF walls have been used widely, fire design of LSF walls is based on approximate prescriptive methods based on limited fire tests. Also these fire tests were conducted using the standard fire curve (ISO 834-1, 1999 [1]) and the applicability of available design rules to realistic design fire curves has not been verified. This paper investigates the accuracy of existing fire design rules in the current cold-formed steel standards and the modifications proposed by previous researchers. Of these the recently developed design rules by Gunalan and Mahendran (2013) [2] based on Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 (EN 1993-1-3, 2006 [3]) and AS/NZS 4600 (Standards Australia (SA), 2005 [4]) for standard fire exposure (ISO 834-1, 1999 [1]) were investigated in detail to determine their applicability to predict the axial compression strengths and fire resistance ratings of LSF walls exposed to realistic design fire curves. This paper also presents the fire performance results of LSF walls exposed to a range of realistic fire curves obtained using a finite element analysis based parametric study. The results from the parametric study were used to develop a simplified design method based on the critical hot flange temperature to predict the fire resistance ratings of LSF walls exposed to realistic fire curves. Finally, the stud failure times (fire resistance rating) obtained from the fire design rules and the simplified design method were compared with parametric study results for LSF walls lined with single and double plasterboards, and externally insulated with rock fibres under realistic fire curves.},

abstract = {Load-bearing Light Gauge Steel Frame (LSF) walls are made of cold-formed steel frames and lined with fire-resistant gypsum plasterboards, and include cavity insulation based on energy performance requirements. Despite the importance of their fire performance, the current fire design methods rely mostly on a prescriptive approach, which relies on fire resistance ratings (FRR) provided by the wall manufacturers due to the lack of knowledge of the various parameters affecting the fire performance of LSF walls. This paper identifies the parameters affecting the fire performance of LSF walls, and presents a detailed review of the fire performance of LSF walls as a function of these parameters, based on recent research studies. It discusses the effects of elevated temperature thermal properties, plasterboard fall-off, cavity insulation, wall configuration, and stud section shapes on the thermal performance of LSF walls, and presents a detailed study of the temperature distribution patterns across the stud cross-sections. Negative effects of plasterboard joints are also demonstrated using fire test results. Elevated temperature mechanical properties of steel, time–temperature profiles of walls, stud section shapes and their sizes were found to be affecting the structural performance of LSF walls in fire, and their effects are discussed. The importance of using accurate elevated temperature mechanical properties in determining the FRR of LSF walls is also demonstrated. A good understanding of the identified parameters on the fire performance of LSF walls can lead to the use of a performance-based fire design method, and development of LSF walls with enhanced fire performance.},

The test apparatus used were a movable radiant panel system, a mid-scale furnace (1.5 m3) and a large-scale furnace (15 m3). The results show that reduced-scale tests are capable of reproducing the heat transferred through the construction at large scale provided there is limited mechanical degradation. The results indicate that the availability of oxygen is fundamental to the fire behaviour of the sandwich composites tested. Reactions occurring in stone wool micro-scale testing, such as oxidative combustion of the binder or crystallisation of the fibres, have a limited effect on the temperature increase when wool is protected from air entrainment.},

abstract = {The residual stresses and strains in cold-formed steel members are a result of the manufacturing process. It has been shown that the variation of residual stresses through the thickness of cold-formed steel members is not linear. In this study a numerical algorithm is developed to calculate the through-thickness variation of residual stresses and strains. The algorithm calculates the stresses and strains by viewing the manufacturing process as a combination of elasto-plastic bending and springback in a wide plate under plane strain conditions. In order to calculate the plastic deformations, the Prandtl-Reuss flow rule associated with von Mises yield criterion is used. With regard to satisfying the boundary conditions on the surface, the bisection method is used to find the location of the neutral axis. The results obtained via the proposed algorithm are verified with the available closed formed solutions, finite element analysis results and experimental measurements. A parametric study is performed to evaluate the effect of the coil radius and cross-sectional and material properties on the residual stresses and strains. It is shown that, while in the corner regions the most important parameter is the corner radius, it is the coil radius and yield stress that play a significant role in the variation of residual stresses and strains in the flat regions.},

The buckling temperatures obtained by the analytical models differed greatly to those obtained from the FEM simulation. Among these analytical models, the buckling temperature obtained through the strut model based on BS5950-1 agreed with the FEM result the best. It is more reasonable to take the width of the compression stress band in the web-post as the effective width of the strut. Numerical parametric studies showed that the width of the compression stress band varied with the opening diameter, the opening distance and the web thickness. A simplified method was proposed to calculate the effective width of the strut. The accuracy of the strut model integrating the new effective width was validated against the FEM simulations. The obtained buckling temperature of the web-post using the modified strut model agreed well with the FEM simulation result.},

The objectives of this study are two-fold: to gain an insight into the physical behaviour and failure modes of this type of structure and to provide some experimental results for detailed numerical studies. A total of 52 strength tests were carried out on short cold-formed lipped channels with and without service holes and unlipped channels at ambient and various elevated temperatures. From these experimental studies, it has been observed that the failure mode of two nominally identical columns can be different even though the failure loads are close. Depending on the thickness of a channel and the location of the service hole, perforation can have an important effect on the strength of the channel, irrespective of the temperature.

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to observe and quantify the relationship between elastic buckling and the tested response of cold-formed steel columns with holes. Compression tests were conducted on 24 short and intermediate length cold-formed steel columns with and without slotted web holes. For each specimen, a shell finite element eigenbuckling analysis was also conducted such that the influence of the boundary conditions and the hole on local, distortional, and global elastic buckling response could also be captured. Slotted web holes may modify the local and distortional elastic buckling half-wavelengths, and may also change the critical elastic buckling loads. Experimentally, slotted web holes are shown to have a minimal influence on the tested ultimate strength in the specimens considered, although post-peak ductility is decreased in some cases. Tangible connections are observed between elastic buckling and load-displacement response during the tests, including mode switching between local and distortional buckling. The columns are tested with friction-bearing boundary conditions where the columns ends are milled flat and parallel, and bear directly on steel platens. These boundary conditions, which greatly speed specimen preparation, are determined to be viable for evaluating the tested response of short and intermediate length columns, although the post-peak response of intermediate length specimens must be considered with care. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It is necessary to capture the behavior of building structures subjected to the post-earthquake fire (PEF) for safety reasons. This study aims to investigate the behavior of unstiffened welded steel connections subjected to the PEF scenario. Experimental tests were carried out on two groups of steel I-beam to hollow column connections with different column wall thicknesses under ISO fire including 4 connections with the same specifications within each group in which 3 connections were tested under the coupling of cyclic loading and subsequent fire while 1 connection was only subjected to fire. All undamaged and pre-damaged connections were tested in a gas furnace under the given constant static load which was about 30{\%} of the ultimate monotonic loading strength of the connections. The furnace temperature, temperature distribution and the deflection of the beam were measured during the fire tests. It was found that the load-carrying capacity of the welded connections decreases significantly with the increase of the pre-damage level. Preliminary finite element modeling was carried out for a heat transfer analysis on the basis of uniform fire exposure as well, which showed nonuniform temperature distribution of the connections.},

Global buckling of cold-formed steel beams and columns, including the influence of holes, is predicted with approximate "weighted average" cross-section properties formulated from classical energy-based stability solutions. Distortional and local buckling of a cold-formed steel member with holes are determined with the semi-analytical finite strip method, considering appropriate modifications to the element thickness and choice of buckling half-wavelength. The proposed methods are verified with shell finite element eigen-buckling studies. Unambiguous, simple methods for elastic buckling prediction of members with holes is central to the extension of the Direct Strength Method (DSM) for cold-formed steel member ultimate strength determination. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Traditionally the fire resistance rating of LSF wall systems is based on approximate prescriptive methods developed using limited fire tests. Therefore a detailed research study into the performance of load bearing LSF wall systems under standard fire conditions was undertaken to develop improved fire design rules. It used the extensive fire performance results of eight different LSF wall systems from a series of full scale fire tests and numerical studies for this purpose. The use of previous fire design rules developed for LSF walls subjected to non-uniform elevated temperature distributions based on AISI design manual and Eurocode3 Parts 1.2 and 1.3 was investigated first. New simplified fire design rules based on AS/NZS 4600, North American Specification and Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 were then proposed in this study with suitable allowances for the interaction effects of compression and bending actions. The importance of considering thermal bowing, magnified thermal bowing and neutral axis shift in the fire design was also investigated. A spread sheet based design tool was developed based on the new design rules to predict the failure load ratio versus time and temperature curves for varying LSF wall configurations. The accuracy of the proposed design rules was verified using the test and FEA results for different wall configurations, steel grades, thicknesses and load ratios. This paper presents the details and results of this study including the improved fire design rules for predicting the load capacity of LSF wall studs and the failure times of LSF walls under standard fire conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Knobloch2006,
abstract = {Local buckling under fire conditions needs to be considered in the context of a wider range of cross-sectional slenderness than in ambient temperatures design. This is due to the distinctly non-linear material behaviour of steel at elevated temperatures, and the large strains required for increasing cross-sectional capacity due to plastification. Stress-based design models, which are commonly used to explain local buckling at ambient temperatures, are not ideal for describing local buckling behaviour under fire conditions. Therefore a new strain-based approach has been developed which uses effective widths for stiffened and unstiffened elements at elevated temperatures. The resulting strain-based formulations avoid the use of section classes for fire design, and take into consideration the plastification effects, plastic stress distribution, and strain-dependent non-linear material behaviour of steel at high temperatures. The use of these formulations extends the application range of current state-of-the-art models for local buckling and non-linear material behaviour. They allow us to consider the decreasing branch of the load-carrying behaviour required during fires, in order to analyse sections with non-uniform temperature distribution. For unstiffened elements in compression at elevated temperatures, the load-carrying behaviour in the buckling and post-buckling ranges was analysed using temperature-dependent second-order linear elastic theory, taking into consideration initial imperfections and yield line theory, which allowed us to formulate a novel strength curve for these elements at elevated temperatures. In a parametric study, the resistance to compression and bending of stiffened and unstiffened elements during fire was calculated. The proposed design approach accords with results produced using the finite element approach.},

Sheathing materials in these walls included gypsum wallboard (GWB), bolivian magnesium board (BMG) and calcium silicate board (CSB). Cyclic loading tests on six full-scale walls of this configuration were conducted, from which the shear performance of the walls could be obtained. Factors such as the sheathing material, aspect ratio, stud section and stud spacing were considered. Another experimental study on the shear behavior of the screw connections was also performed to explore the potential relationship between the walls and the screw connections in shear performance. The results showed that the peak strength of the walls sheathed with bolivian magnesium boards as the face layer wallboards significantly exceeded the nominal value of the current standard. However, for the walls sheathed with calcium silicate boards as the face layer wallboards, the tested walls exhibited brittleness damage with poor ductility after the peak strength. The equivalent-bracing model was used to calculate the lateral stiffness of the walls, based on which a series of screw connection deformation limits and shear-wall drift angle limits was suggested.},

abstract = {A numerical study of a turbulent penetrative and recirculating flow induced by the energy input from a fire at the bottom boundary in a partially open rectangular enclosure is carried out. The compartment is connected through an opening to a long corridor, which opens into a stably stratified environment. The condition that is of interest is a stable, two-layered, temperature stratification, which is assumed to be caused by fire in an adjacent enclosure. In this study, attention is focused on the interaction between the cavity and its surrounding ambient medium through the opening. The influence of the stratification is examined in the turbulent flow regime by considering a range of stratification levels for given opening height and initial interface location. It is found that, depending on the stratification, the thermal plume above the fire may never reach the ceiling. Small penetration distances occur at large stratification levels. The flow field reveals a multicellular pattern: a strong main convective cell at the bottom and a weak counterrotating cell at the top. The stable thermal stratification can cause a destruction of the turbulence. This results in the relaminarization of the flow in the upper region of the cavity and may significantly affect the transport processes in the enclosure. This could distort the simplistic concept of two homogeneous gas layers, which forms the basis of zone modeling for compartment fires. {\textcopyright} 1995 by ASME.},

abstract = {Most previous fire experiments of cold-formed steel (CFS) walls focused on the ISO 834 or the E119 fire curve. Although the fire performance of CFS walls under ISO 834 or E119 curve can be theoretically converted to that under other fire curves, the corresponding time equivalency methods have not been experimentally examined. This paper presents an experimental investigation of non-load-bearing CFS walls under four different fire conditions. It is proved by the experiments that the maximum temperature of the design fire curve is one of the most important indexes for representing the severity of fire exposure. Especially, the maximum temperature of 680 °C for external fire was not severe to the present non-load-bearing CFS walls. Two specimens were subjected to 285 min of external fire but demonstrated an almost steady-state heat transfer process. Meanwhile, the hydrocarbon fire and realistic design fire demonstrated much more severe damage. It is also proved for the first time that neither the equal area method nor the energy-based method was suitable for the fire-resistance time equivalency of CFS walls. Based on post fire observation, significant local crushing of studs was identified, especially after the fall off of fire-side sheathing. Additionally, it was found that replacing the fire-side base-layer gypsum plasterboard with low-bulk-density calcium-silicate board extends the insulation and structure performance of CFS walls under fire conditions. Moreover, a simplified temperature distribution model and the critical temperature on the fall off of fire-side gypsum plasterboard were recommended for the numerical modeling of CFS walls.},

In particular, a weak coupling approach used to simulate a fire exposed structure by modelling the fire development in the compartment, the heat penetration in the structure and the mechanical response is described. The advantages and the disadvantages of such a technique are highlighted compared to a full coupling that conversely takes into account all mutual interactions. The favourable aspect of computing the thermal response of the structure in the FE model in order to avoid modelling the structure in the CFD model is underlined, namely a sensitive reduction of computational demand. Finally, the study is enriched by an application of this methodology that concerns the simulation of a pool fire in an open compartment the results of which are compared with those obtained by employing the simplified Hasemi model included in the Eurocodes.},

It was shown that ultimate behaviors such as ultimate strength, failure mode and curling occurrence by FEA were in a good agreement with those of test results. Based on the reasonable prediction accuracy of numerical approach, parametric studies on single shear two-row bolted connections with extended variables; plate thickness, end distance in the direction of load and edge distance perpendicular to the direction of load is conducted in order to consider the strength reduction effect due to curling. It can be found that Kuwamura's equations, which has been specified by Stainless Steel Building Association of Japan (SSBA) design manual are more valid for estimating the ultimate strength of bolted connections with no curling when compared to other design standards, whereas for connections curled in test and FEA results, since SSBA design standard does not consider the curling effect, the ultimate strength of connection was overestimated. Consequently, revised design formulae considering the effect of curling on bolted connection are proposed in this paper using correlations between strength reduction ratio and plate thickness. Furthermore, the validation of the design equations is verified through comparisons with existing test and additional FEA results.},

Effect of horizontal and vertical air gap orientations on sensor temperature rise, heat flux, thermal protection and fluid flow behavior are analyzed. Results shows that thermal protection with the vertical air gap orientation is significantly better than the protection offered by the horizontal air gap orientation and the difference increases as the air gap width increases. Dynamic mesh technique is used in order to investigate the effect of dynamic air gap which results because of the body movement during heat exposure. Body movement is considered to be such that variation of the air gap with time is sinusoidal. Effect of motion frequency and average air gap width are also studied. Significant difference in convective and total heat flux as well as flow pattern is observed for cases with dynamically varying air gap.},

abstract = {Fire resistance of load bearing Light Gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems is important to protect lives and properties in fire accidents. Recent fire tests of LSF walls made of the new cold-formed and welded hollow flange channel (HFC) section studs and the commonly used lipped channel section (LCS) studs have shown the influence of stud sections on the fire resistance rating (FRR) of LSF walls. To advance the use of HFC section studs and to verify the outcomes from the fire tests, finite element models were developed to predict the structural fire performance of LSF walls made of welded HFC section studs. The developed models incorporated the measured non-uniform temperature distributions in LSF wall studs due to the exposure of standard fire on one side, and accurate elevated temperature mechanical properties of steel used in the stud sections. These models simulated the various complexities involved such as thermal bowing and neutral axis shift caused by the non-uniform temperature distribution in the studs. The finite element analysis (FEA) results agreed well with the full scale fire test results including the FRR, outer hot and cold flange temperatures at failure and axial deformation and lateral displacement profiles. They also confirmed the superior fire performance of LSF walls made of HFC section studs. The applicability of both transient and steady state FEA of LSF walls under fire conditions was verified in this study, which also investigated the effects of using various temperature distribution patterns across the cross-section of HFC section studs on the FRR of LSF walls.

abstract = {The main goal of this study is to increase the knowledge on the behaviour of steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling at both normal and elevated temperatures. Hence, numerical models were duly validated with experimental tests from the literature. Experimental tests on steel plate girders with different configurations were numerically reproduced, showing a good agreement between numerical and experimental results. Afterwards, applying the validated numerical models, sensitivity analyses on the influence of initial imperfections were performed. Different values for the maximum amplitude of geometric imperfections were considered and residual stresses were also taken into account. Finally, the effect of the end supports configuration was also studied aiming to understand the strength enhancement given by the rigid end support at normal temperature and evaluating if that strength enhancement is maintained in case of fire.},

abstract = {Experiments on circular steel tubes filled with steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) and normal concrete have been performed to investigate the contribution of steel fibres to the load bearing capacity of short composite columns. The main variables considered in the test study are diameter to thickness ratio of the steel tube and the percentage of steel fibres added to the in-filled concrete. All the specimens were tested under axial compression until failure state realization. Extensive strain and deformation measurements were taken at compression and tension zones and the results show that 1.00{\%} SFRC in-filled steel columns exhibit enhanced ultimate load carrying capacity, stiffness and ductility coefficient. Also a nonlinear finite element model was developed to study the load carrying mechanism of CFTs using the Finite Element software version ABAQUS. This model was validated using the experimental load-deformation curves and the corresponding modes of collapse. A comparison of the observed load carrying capacity and flexural stiffness with various codal recommendations has been carried out to check the applicability of the expressions recommended by the various codes of practice. Of all the codes compared, Eurocode 4 showed the least variation and is found to be more viable to predict the strength of normal as well as SFRC in-filled steel tubes under axial compression.},

abstract = {Lightweight steel-framed (LSF) structural elements in building construction provide a way of increasing building sustainability. These structural elements present great potential for recycling and reuse, allowing the conservation of natural resources and the environment. When compared with other materials, these construction components also provide other advantages: reduced weight with simultaneous high mechanical strength; easier prefabrication, allowing modular elements and higher quality control; shorter periods for assembling the building on-site; no dimensional variations caused by moisture; and low cost. The high thermal conductivity of steel could be a drawback, leading to thermal bridges if not well designed and executed. In the case of LSF components (e.g. walls and slabs) it is necessary to take special care with the elements' design optimisation, with it being essential to use continuous thermal insulation. The building envelope thermal performance is crucial to provide good thermal behaviour and energy efficiency, allowing a reduction of operational energy. In this paper, the LSF construction system is analysed in order to show its main advantages and drawbacks. The assessment of embodied and operational energy is essential to perform a life cycle analysis. The reduction of both energies' consumption is crucial to increase the sustainability label. Special focus will be given to the mitigation strategies of operational energy in LSF construction.},

abstract = {The topic of this paper is the fire safety analysis of 3D frame structures such as industrial halls. Cold-formed thin plated elements are used as structural components. The building, which is submitted to a full-scale fire test, is introduced. A blind prediction analysis is performed using the finite element model SAFIR. The thermal response of the structural elements under both a standard fire and a natural fire corresponding to a fire load density of 625 MJ/m2 and an opening factor 0.009 m1/2 is predicted. As expected, the temperature of the cold-formed sections follows more or less the gas temperature in the fire compartment due to the thin plates. The results of the predicted mechanical response are presented, giving a resistance of 27 min (standard fire) and 54 min (natural fire). The model is validated based on the results of the full-scale fire test, demonstrating a fire resistance of 62 min. Comparison with a simple 2.5D model is made and proved to provide results sufficiently accurate to make it applicable for daily design practice.},

abstract = {As a high-efficiency and versatile production approach, roll forming process, which involves a continuous roll set system, can bend the flat sheet to targeted sectional configurations gradually. During the process, the sheet experiences a repeat bending-unbending at each roll set and residual stress will hence be induced as it is loaded beyond the elastic limit. To understand the relationship between the issued residual stress and the load-bearing capacity of the sigma beam, this paper reveals the residual stress distribution in cold roll-formed beam with sigma sections by using dynamic numerical analysis at the first instance. Such initial Finite element Analysis (FEA) outcomes were compared and validated by X-ray diffraction measurement results. Good agreement was achieved in terms of stress distribution and magnitude. Using these reliable residual stresses as input, more numerical models of the roll-formed sigma beams with internal support were established to investigate the influences of residual stress on the load-bearing capacity of the beam. The outcomes obtained indicate that the ultimate load-bearing capacity of the sigma beam is slightly decreased in the presence of the residual stress, as the resistance of the innerweb will be deteriorated by the compressive residual stress in the place.},

abstract = {Light gauge Steel Framed (LSF) wall panels are essential components in the construction of residential and commercial buildings. They are used as load bearing and non-load bearing walls in low and mid-rise buildings. During fire events, LSF wall lining material acts as a thermal barrier against fire propagation through the wall and protects the thin-walled steel studs from higher temperatures. Many detailed studies have been conducted to investigate the thermal and structural behaviour of gypsum plasterboard lined load bearing LSF walls exposed to fire conditions. However, such studies are limited for non-load bearing LSF walls. The behavioural characteristics of non-load bearing LSF walls are different from those of load bearing walls with only insulation or integrity failures governing their fire design. Small-scale non-load bearing wall fire tests do not simulate the actual fire behaviour, rather they only provide comparative results for tests conducted under identical conditions. This paper presents the details of a detailed experimental study conducted on the fire performance of 3 m high non-load bearing LSF walls, and the results. Full-scale standard fire tests were conducted and the effects of gypsum plasterboard thickness, wall configurations and noggings on the fire performance of non-load bearing walls were quantified. Fire test results were compared based on the measured stud and gypsum plasterboard temperatures. This paper has provided very useful fire test data for use in the fire design of non-load bearing LSF walls, which can also be used in developing advanced thermal finite element models and their calibration.},

abstract = {Energy conversion devices undergo thermal loading during their operation as a result of inefficiencies in the energy conversion process. This will eventually lead to degradation and possible failure of the device if the heat generated is not properly managed. The ability to accurately predict the thermal behavior of such a device during the initial developmental stage is an important requirement. However, accurate predictions of critical temperature is challenging due to the variation of heat transfer parameters from one device to another. The ability to determine the model parameters is key to accurately representing the heat transfer in such a device. This paper presents the use of an inverse identification technique to estimate the model parameters of an energy conversion device designed for vehicular applications. To simulate the imperfect contact and the presence of insulating materials in the permanent magnet electric machine, thin material are introduced at the component interface of the numerical model. The proposed inverse identification method is used to estimate the equivalent thermal conductance of the thin material. In addition, the electromagnetic losses generated in the permanent magnet is also derived indirectly from the temperature measurement using the same method. With the thermal properties and input parameters of the numerical model obtained from the inverse identification method, the critical temperature of the device can be predicted more accurately. The deviation between the maximum measured and predicted winding temperature is less than 2.4{\%}.},

It is thought that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) functions in the RAS, in addition to involvement in thrombotic risk and fibrosis. This study investigated possible links between angiotensinogen (AGT) genotypes (M235T/MM, MT, TT) and PAI-1 genotypes (4G4G, 4G5G, 5G5G) and CAD assessments of both types of polymorphism were performed in 82 renal allograft recipients. One hundred healthy subjects were also investigated for AGT polymorphism, and 80 healthy subjects for PAI-1 polymorphism. Genotypes were determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequence-specific primers, and PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Kidney recipients with CAD had significantly lower frequencies of the MM genotype and the M allele than the recipients without CAD (p {\textless} 0.05 and {\textless}0.001). The transplant recipients with CAD also had significantly lower frequencies of the 5G5G genotype and the 5G allele than those without CAD (p {\textless} 0.001 and {\textless}0.05). Determination of AGT M235T and PAI-1 genotypes prior to transplantation may help identify patients who at risk for chronic renal transplant dysfunction.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel members have many advantages over hot-rolled steel members. However, they are susceptible to various buckling modes at stresses below the yield stress of the member because of their relatively high width-to-thickness ratio. Web crippling is one of the failure modes that can occur when the members are subjected to transverse high concentrated loadings and/or reactions. The four common loading conditions are the end-one-flange (EOF), interior-one-flange (IOF), end-two-flange (ETF) and interior-two-flange (ITF) loadings. Recently a new test method has been proposed by AISI to obtain the web crippling capacities under these four loading conditions. Using this test method 38 tests were conducted in this research to investigate the web crippling behaviour and strength of channel beams under ETF and ITF cases. Unlipped channel sections having a nominal yield stress of 450 MPa were tested with different web slenderness and bearing lengths. The flanges of these channel sections were not fastened to the supports. In this research the suitability of the current design rules in AS/NZS 4600 and the AISI S100 Specification for unlipped channels subject to web crippling was investigated, and suitable modifications were proposed where necessary. In addition to this, a new design rule was proposed based on the direct strength method to predict the web crippling capacities of tested beams. This paper presents the details of this experimental study and the results.},

abstract = {Gypsum plasterboards are commonly used as a fire safety material in the building industry. Many research studies have been undertaken to investigate the thermal behaviour of plasterboards under standard fire conditions. However, there are many discrepancies in relation to the basic thermal properties of plasterboards while simple equations are not available to predict the ambient surface time–temperature profiles of gypsum plasterboard panels that can be used in simulating the behaviour and strength of steel studs or joists in load bearing LSF wall and floor systems. In this research, suitable thermal properties of plasterboards were proposed based on a series of tests and available results from past research. Finite element models of gypsum plasterboard panels were then developed to simulate their thermal behaviour under standard fire conditions. The accuracy of the proposed thermal properties and the finite element models was validated by comparing the numerical results with available fire test results of plasterboard panels. This paper presents the details of the finite element models of plasterboard panels, the thermal analysis results from finite element analyses under standard fire conditions and their comparisons with experimental results.},

abstract = {At elevated temperatures induced by fire loading, the I-section beam and column elements in a steel framed building experience combinations of axial, bending and shearing actions that may precipitate local buckling of the steel element. Under this loading regime, the Young's modulus, shear modulus and uniaxial yield strength may vary through the section depth because of the temperature gradient, and as a result predicting the local buckling capacity and the critical geometrical slenderness for coincident elastic local buckling and yielding are not straightforward. This paper presents an analysis of the elastic local buckling of the web of an I-section beam, by modifying a spline finite strip method of local buckling analysis to include the variation of material properties through the web. Necessarily, the method must also include the variation of mechanical strains through the web depth, in order that the limiting depth to thickness ratio that delineates yielding and elastic buckling (and hence the cross-section classification) can be prescribed. Under the combined loading, it is shown how the elastic local buckling coefficient and the web slenderness limit that classifies a non-compact section are dependent on the thermal gradient, the depth of the compression zone in the representation of the mechanical strain, and on the values of the shear strain. Graphical results are presented for the elastic local buckling coefficients as a function of the temperature and of the temperature gradient in a web with idealised edge restraint conditions. Since the local buckling response is crucial in establishing the formation hinges in flexural elements in the initial stages of thermal loading prior to the subsequent development of catenary action, the results are valuable for undertaking a rational fire engineering design of the steel elements exposed to a compartment fire, and they lend themselves to a codified approach for the structural behaviour.},

Plate girders were numerically tested at both normal and elevated temperature, considering three different uniform temperatures 350 °C, 500 °C and 600 °C. The influence of the geometrical imperfections, as well as the residual stresses, was taken into account. Finally, the numerical results were compared to the EC3 prescriptions for shear buckling and shear–bending interaction safety verifications, adapted to fire situation by the direct application of the reduction factors for the stress-strain relationship of steel at elevated temperatures.},

abstract = {To study the bearing capacity and failure mechanism of a square stainless steel column in fire, a series of tests were performed on S30408 stainless steel, including 6 material mechanical property tests at room temperature, 16 material mechanical property tests at elevated temperature and fire experiments on 8 square sections of stainless steel columns. Steady tests at elevated temperature were performed to investigate the mechanical properties of stainless steel. The stress–strain curve, elastic modulus, yield strength and the reduction factor of the ultimate strength of stainless steel at elevated temperature were determined, and the test results were compared with the European Codes. The experiments studied the properties of the square section stainless steel columns without axial constraints in fire, which were compressed axially and eccentrically. The failure phenomenon, heating curve, deformation curve and critical temperature of the specimens were obtained. The effects of the load ratio, section dimension and eccentricity on the critical temperature and fire-resistance performance of the stainless steel column were examined. The test results show that load ratio and eccentricity are the key factors for critical temperature and fire-resistance performance of the stainless steel column without axial constraints.},

abstract = {This article investigates the thermal performance of gypsum boards in the dehydration temperature region, where pronounced chemical reactivity is anticipated. Gypsum board samples were gradually heated up to 300°C, using a low heating rate. Temperature measurements at pre-selected board locations indicated three distinct stages of gypsum dehydration; free moisture evaporation, transformation of calcium sulfate dihydrate to calcium sulfate hemi-hydrate and of calcium sulfate hemi-hydrate to calcium sulfate anhydrate. Physical properties of the gypsum board sample, that is density, specific heat, and thermal conductivity, were measured as a function of the dehydration temperature range. Results suggested that the thermal conductivity of the calcium anhydrate sulfate is higher than that of the hemi-hydrate, despite the fact that gypsum porosity increases during the dehydration process. Based on the experimental results, correlations for the thermal conductivity and the dehydration energy as a function of the mass loss during the dehydration process and the initial water content of the gypsum board, respectively, were obtained.},

abstract = {Purpose This research was aimed at investigating the fire performance of LSF wall systems by using 3-D heat transfer FE models of existing LSF wall system configurations. Design/methodology/approach This research was focused on investigating the fire performance of LSF wall systems by using 3-D heat transfer finite element models of existing LSF wall system configurations. The analysis results were validated by using the available fire test results of five different LSF wall configurations. Findings The validated finite element models were used to conduct a parametric study on a range of non-load bearing and load bearing LSF wall configurations to predict their fire resistance levels (FRLs) for varying load ratios. Originality/value Fire performance of LSF wall systems with different configurations can be understood by performing full-scale fire tests. However, these full-scale fire tests are time consuming, labour intensive and expensive. On the other hand, finite element analysis (FEA) provides a simple method of investigating the fire performance of LSF wall systems to understand their thermal-mechanical behaviour. Recent numerical research studies have focused on investigating the fire performances of LSF wall systems by using finite element (FE) models. Most of these FE models were developed based on 2-D FE platform capable of performing either heat transfer or structural analysis separately. Therefore, this paper presents the details of a 3-D FEA methodology to develop the capabilities to perform fully-coupled thermal-mechanical analyses of LSF walls exposed to fire in future.},

abstract = {The accuracy of structural fire design of cold-formed steel structures depends on the available predictive models regarding mechanical and thermal properties. The deterioration of mechanical properties, such as yield strength and modulus of elasticity, and the evolution of thermal properties, such as thermal conductivity, thermal elongation and specific heat, with temperature is a key issue in the assessment of the performance of cold-formed steel structural elements in fire. An experimental campaign was undertaken to determine both mechanical and thermal properties of the S280GD+Z steel used in cold-formed steel building construction industry. Tensile coupon tests were carried out to determine the mechanical properties of the S280 GD+Z steel with 2.5 mm thickness at temperatures ranging from 20 to 800 °C. Thermal properties were assessed using the Transient Plane Source (TPS) equipment. Test results were compared with current design standards and with the ones available in the literature. The proposed predictive equations based on the Ramberg-Osgood model show very good agreement with the experimental results for temperatures beyond 300 °C. It was found that some predictive models presented in the EN 1993-1-2:2005 regarding mechanical and thermal properties should be improved. Hence new proposals are presented for both thermal and mechanical properties. Also a modified stress-strain model based on the EN 1993-1-2:2005 formulation is proposed for the S280GD+Z steel.},

abstract = {In recent times, light gauge cold-formed steel sections have been used extensively as primary load-bearing structural members in many applications in the building industry. Fire safety design of structures using such sections has, therefore, become more important. Deterioration of mechanical properties of yield stress and elasticity modulus is considered the most important factor affecting the performance of steel structures in fires. Hence, there is a need to fully understand the mechanical properties of light gauge cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures. A research project based on experimental studies was, therefore, undertaken to investigate the deterioration of mechanical properties of light gauge cold-formed steels. Tensile coupon tests were undertaken to determine the mechanical properties of these steels made of both low- and high-strength steels and thicknesses of 0.60, 0.80 and 0.95 mm at temperatures ranging from 20 to 800 °C. Test results showed that the currently available reduction factors are unsafe to use in the fire safety design of cold-formed steel structures. Therefore, new predictive equations were developed for the mechanical properties of yield strength and elasticity modulus at elevated temperatures. This paper presents the details of the experimental study, and the results including the developed equations. It also includes details of a stress–strain model for light gauge cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures.},

abstract = {To satisfy the requirements of fire resistance and loading capacity of the walls in multi-story cold-formed steel (CFS) structures, shear walls sheathed with double-layer wallboards on both sides were proposed. Sheathing materials in these walls included gypsum wallboard (GWB), bolivian magnesium board (BMG) and calcium silicate board (CSB). Cyclic loading tests on six full-scale walls of this configuration were conducted, from which the shear performance of the walls could be obtained. Factors such as the sheathing material, aspect ratio, stud section and stud spacing were considered. Another experimental study on the shear behavior of the screw connections was also performed to explore the potential relationship between the walls and the screw connections in shear performance. The results showed that the peak strength of the walls sheathed with bolivian magnesium boards as the face layer wallboards significantly exceeded the nominal value of the current standard. However, for the walls sheathed with calcium silicate boards as the face layer wallboards, the tested walls exhibited brittleness damage with poor ductility after the peak strength. The equivalent-bracing model was used to calculate the lateral stiffness of the walls, based on which a series of screw connection deformation limits and shear-wall drift angle limits was suggested.},

The vehicle body temperature profile from the heat transfer analysis is applied as an input for a structural analysis to predict buckling. This study is focused on the radiant section of the curing ovens. The radiant section of the oven has the largest temperature gradients within the body structure. This methodology couples a fully transient thermal analysis to simulate the structure through the electro-coat and paint curing environments with a structural, buckling analysis. The ability to predict the buckling phenomenon using a virtual simulation will reduce the risk of late production changes to the vehicle class “A” surfaces.},

abstract = {The general aim of the research for this thesis was to develop models to predict the performance of fire resistant light-timber framed walls, in relation to requirements of new performance-based building fire regulations being introduced around the world. The performance bases that were adopted in the modelling, were time and probability of failure. The models that were developed for a wide range of wall types, and have been specifically validated for ordinary cavity walls and double framed walls. Validation involved numerical checks for convergence and energy conservation, and the undertaking of eight full scale wall furnace experiments with well controlled conditions. Values of thermal properties of materials in the walls were obtained with simple independent experiments. These experiments helped to clarify appropriate values from the wide ranges which have been previously published. Model predictions were evaluated against results published in the literature. The models comprise specific models for fire severity, heat transfer, structural response and probability of failure. This research has developed the heat transfer model named ADIDRAS, a probability model, and undertaken all linkages of models to produce the time and probability of failure models. A model developed by a colleague, Young, was adopted for the structural response model. The time and probability of failure models can incorporate most fire severity models. In this research, two fire severity models were incorporated; one was the standard fire, and the other was the real fire severity model of Kawagoe and Lie. ADIDRAS, in several respects, is an advance on previous heat transfer models for structures containing cavities. It analyses thermal diffusion with alternating direction implicit finite difference analysis which enhances numerical stability without the loss of computation speed of explicit procedures. It uses the discrete radiation method which enables analysis of radiant heat transfer through smoke and cavities of any shape. Previous models have analysed only cavities without re-entrant corners. It was deduced that when the interfaces between studs and gypsum board on the fire side reach temperatures greater than 400°C, the interfaces open to form gaps due to shrinkage in these materials. These gaps prevent much of the heat transferring directly from gypsum board to the studs, and divert the heat to the cavity by radiation. This diversion explains some anomalies between experimental results and predictions of previously published heat transfer models. It is shown that temperatures in studs are insensitive to the transmissivity of radiant heat in smoke. The structural model and the time of failure model have been applied, to obtain for the first time, relationships between the time of failure and a number of variables including vertical load, elastic modulus of timber, strength of timber, height of wall, size and spacing of studs, initial crookedness of studs and thickness of gypsum board. The time of failure model has established failure, induced by the vaporisation of moisture, is critical for walls that are either higher than walls commonly built (higher than 3.6 metres), or are more heavily loaded than is currently permitted in timber structural engineering codes. It was found that the time of failure is most sensitive to fire temperature, vertical load, elastic modulus of timber in compression, and density and specific heat of timber. It is sensitive also to the thickness and thermal properties of gypsum board, and the sectional dimensions of studs; however, these variables are unlikely to vary much for walls built to specifications in common building construction. It is considered that the probability of failure model is the first theoretically-based reliability model for light-timber framed structures exposed to fire. Several applications of the model have been demonstrated. It was shown that the variabilities of thermal properties of gypsum board and wood are low compared with the large variabilities of mechanical properties inherent in timber. In the applications demonstrated, typical variations of all variables led to a coefficient of variation (Co V) in the time of failure of 0.12 for typical walls subjected to standard (ASI530A) fire. Exposure to a real fire did not significantly affect this CoY. Unlike the standard fire, the real fire did not necessarily lead to collapse. There is much scope for reducing fife resistances of walls without significantly increasing the risk to life.},

abstract = {The lateral behavior of sheathed, cold-formed steel (CFS) framed shear walls depends considerably on the complex behavior that occurs at each fastener location. Screw fasteners attach the sheathing material to the CFS framing, but relative motion of these components creates local damage, resulting in non-linearity at the scale of the entire shear wall. A computational model of a CFS shear wall is developed in which each fastener is represented by a non-linear, radially-symmetric spring element. The material parameters of the fastener element are determined from physical tests of sheathing-to-stud connections with small numbers of fasteners. The fastener material model includes a softening backbone curve, pinching, and loading and unloading parameters. The remainder of the model employs rigid sheathing panels, beam–column elements for framing, semi-rigid rotational springs for stud-to-track connections, and springs for hold-downs. The models are subjected to lateral cyclic displacement histories using the OpenSees structural analysis software. Thirteen full-scale shear wall tests of two different widths are modeled with various construction details related to the ledger track, gypsum board, vertical and horizontal seams, and number and thickness of field studs. The computational analyses are compared to the full-scale physical tests based on load–displacement behavior, lateral strength, drift at failure, initial stiffness, and energy dissipation, and are compared to specification-based strengths and displacements. The computational models provide detailed information on forces in the framing members and interaction forces at individual fasteners. This fastener-based computational approach is able to efficiently reproduce key aspects of the lateral behavior of CFS shear walls.},

abstract = {This paper presents numerical simulations of the fire behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) beams flexurally strengthened with carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips installed according to the externally bonded reinforcement (EBR) and near surface mounted (NSM) techniques. Three dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) models of the beams were developed, in which the temperature-dependent thermophysical and mechanical properties of the constituent materials was considered. The CFRP-concrete interaction was modelled by means of bi-linear bond-slip laws previously calibrated by the authors for different temperatures. Comparisons between numerical and previous experimental results confirmed the accuracy of the models in predicting the thermo-mechanical response of insulated CFRP-strengthened RC beams exposed to fire. The results obtained highlight the possibility of exploring the CFRP mechanical contribution in fire through a “cable” behaviour by applying a thicker insulation in the CFRP anchorage zones. Moreover, the numerical results confirmed the better fire performance of the NSM strengthening technique when compared to EBR: with the latter technique CFRP debonding occurred after considerably shorter periods of fire exposure and for much lower average temperatures in the adhesive in the anchorage zones, from 1.2 × Tg to 1.4 × Tg, with such range being 2.4 × Tg to 4.2 × Tg for the NSM system.},

abstract = {Simplified methods for approximating the global, distortional, and local critical elastic buckling loads of cold-formed steel columns and beams with holes are developed and summarized. These methods provide engineering approximations appropriate for design, but are intended to be general enough to accommodate the range of hole shapes, locations, and spacings common in industry. The simplified methods are developed as a convenient alternative to shell finite element eigen-buckling analysis, which require laborious and subjective visual identification methods as well as commercial software not generally accessible to the engineering community. Global buckling of cold-formed steel beams and columns, including the influence of holes, is predicted with approximate “weighted average” cross-section properties formulated from classical energy-based stability solutions. Distortional and local buckling of a cold-formed steel member with holes are determined with the semi-analytical finite strip method, considering appropriate modifications to the element thickness and choice of buckling half-wavelength. The proposed methods are verified with shell finite element eigen-buckling studies. Unambiguous, simple methods for elastic buckling prediction of members with holes is central to the extension of the Direct Strength Method (DSM) for cold-formed steel member ultimate strength determination.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel sections are commonly used in low-rise commercial and residential buildings. During fire events, cold-formed steel structural elements in these buildings will be exposed to elevated temperatures. Hence after such events there is a need to evaluate the residual strength of these structural elements. However, only limited information is available in relation to the residual strength of fire exposed cold-formed steel sections. This means conservative decisions are often made in relation to fire exposed building structures. This research is aimed at investigating the buckling capacities of fire exposed cold-formed lipped channel steel sections. A series of compression tests of fire exposed, short lipped channel columns made of varying steel grades and thicknesses was undertaken in this research. Test columns were first exposed to different elevated temperatures up to 800 oC. They were then allowed to cool down at ambient temperatures before they were tested to failure. Similarly tensile coupon tests were also undertaken after being exposed to various elevated temperatures, from which the residual mechanical properties (yield stress and Young's modulus) of the steels used in this study were derived. Using these mechanical properties, the residual compression capacities of tested short columns were predicted using the currently used design rules in AS/NZS 4600 and AISI cold-formed steel standards. This comparison showed that ambient temperature design rules for compression members can be used to predict the residual compression capacities of fire exposed short or laterally restrained cold-formed steel columns provided the maximum temperature experienced by the columns can be estimated after a fire event. Such residual capacity assessments will allow structural and fire engineers to make an accurate prediction of the safety of fire exposed buildings. This paper presents the details of this experimental study and the results.},

abstract = {Recently an innovative composite panel system was developed, where a thin insulation layer was used externally between two plasterboards to improve the fire performance of light gauge cold-formed steel frame walls. In this research, finite-element thermal models of both the traditional light gauge cold-formed steel frame wall panels with cavity insulation and the new light gauge cold-formed steel frame composite wall panels were developed to simulate their thermal behaviour under standard and realistic fire conditions. Suitable apparent thermal properties of gypsum plasterboard, insulation materials and steel were proposed and used. The developed models were then validated by comparing their results with available fire test results. This article presents the details of the developed finite-element models of small-scale non-load-bearing light gauge cold-formed steel frame wall panels and the results of the thermal analysis. It has been shown that accurate finite-element models can be used to simulate the thermal behaviour of small-scale light gauge cold-formed steel frame walls with varying configurations of insulations and plasterboards. The numerical results show that the use of cavity insulation was detrimental to the fire rating of light gauge cold-formed steel frame walls, while the use of external insulation offered superior thermal protection to them. The effects of real fire conditions are also presented.},

The assembly without fire stops was tested to investigate the effect of the depth of the vertical air space (13 mm, 25 mm or 38 mm for wood studs and 25 mm for steel studs), inside insulated double‐stud walls, on fire spread to the upper storey cavity between the studs.

abstract = {Fibre reinforced polymers (FRPs) have demonstrated good performance in retrofitting deteriorated reinforced concrete structures. However, there remains a paucity of information on the performance of available FRP strengthening systems at elevated temperatures, and the perceived susceptibility of these systems to fire continues to discourage their use in some applications. To begin to address this issue for the specific case of strengthening rectangular concrete columns with FRP wraps, an experimental and analytical study has been performed. An objective of the study is to develop validated computational models that can be used to perform parametric analyses and suggest design guidelines for these types of structural members. This paper presents the development and partial verification of a computational model that can simulate the structural behaviour of a short or slender, concentrically or eccentrically loaded, unwrapped or FRP wrapped column under both ambient and fire conditions. Results of initial analytical studies, including validation of the model using test data available in the literature, are presented.},

abstract = {A total of 87 cold-formed stainless steel single shear bolted connections was conducted. The specimens were tested using transient state test method. The single shear bolted connection specimens were fabricated by three different grades of stainless steel. The three different grades of stainless steel are austenitic stainless steel EN 1.4301 (AISI 304) and EN 1.4571 (AISI 316Ti having small amount of titanium) as well as lean duplex stainless steel EN 1.4162 (AISI S32101). Three different load levels of 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 of the failure load at room temperature were investigated. The tendency of the test strength reduction of the stainless steel single shear bolted connections conducted using the transient state test method is similar to those results obtained by the steady state test method. However, the critical temperatures determined by the transient state test results are usually slightly higher compared with those deduced from the steady state test results at the load levels of 0.25 and 0.50 of the failure load at room temperature. The austenitic stainless steel grade EN 1.4571 (AISI 316Ti) generally has better resistance than the other two stainless steel grades in transient state tests as higher values of critical temperatures were obtained. Two main failure modes, namely the bearing and net section tension failures, were observed in the transient state tests. The failure modes of the specimens in transient state tests at the load level of 0.25 are generally consistent with those specimens in the steady state tests.},

abstract = {Principles of mathematical models as tools in engineering and science are discussed in relation to turbulent combustion modeling. A model is presented for the rate of combustion which takes into account the intermittent appearance of reacting species in turbulent flames. This model relates the rate of combustion to the rate of dissipation of eddies and expresses the rate of reaction by the mean concentration of a reacting specie, the turbulent kinetic energy and the rate of dissipation of this energy. The essential features of this model are that it does not call for predictions of fluctuations of reacting species and that it is applicable to premixed as well as diffusion flames. The combustion model is tested on both premixed and diffusion flames with good results. Special attention is given to soot formation and combustion in turbulent flames. Predictions are made for two C2 H2 turbulent diffusion flames by incorporating both the above combustion model and the model for the rate of soot formation developed by Tesner et al., as well as previous observations by Magnussen concerning the behavior of soot in turbulent flames. The predicted results are in close agreement with the experimental data. All predictions in the present paper have been made by modeling turbulence by the k-∈ model. Buoyancy is taken into consideration in the momentum equations. Effects of terms containing density fluctuations have not been included. {\textcopyright} 1977 Combustion Institute.},

abstract = {The behavior of high-strength structural steel at elevated temperatures, especially under shear loading, is not well established in the literature. This paper presents results from recently conducted tests on high-strength structural bolts subject to double shear loading at elevated temperatures. The parameters varied between tests included the bolt grade, bolt diameter, and temperature. Bolt grades A325 and A490 were tested. For each bolt grade, three different diameters were tested (19 mm (3/4 in), 22 mm (7/8 in), and 25.4 mm (1 in)) at five different temperatures (20 °C, 200 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C). At least three tests were conducted for each combination of parameters. Degradations in the mechanical and material properties including stiffness, strength, and deformation at fracture, are characterized and presented herein. The results from these experiments fill a critical knowledge gap currently present in the literature regarding the behavior of high-strength structural bolts under shear loading at elevated temperatures. These data will ultimately provide a thorough understanding of the overall behavior of structural steel systems under realistic fire loading by clarifying the (i) shear behavior of high-strength structural steel bolts at elevated temperatures, and (ii) degradation in the mechanical and material properties of high-strength steel bolts with increasing temperatures.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel (CFS) wall systems were increasingly used as primary load-bearing structural components in residential and industrial buildings. Previous studies were mainly to investigate the fire performance of non-load bearing CFS wall systems lined with gypsum plasterboards. In order to improve the fire performance of load-bearing CFS wall systems more efficiently, this paper presented a detailed experimental investigation on five full-scale CFS walls lined with double layers of three different fire resistant panels on both sides, including fire-resistant gypsum plasterboard, bolivian magnesium board and calcium silicate board. The results showed a noticeable disadvantage of the calcium silicate board due to explosive spalling at high temperatures, and this might cause severe safety issues in an actual fire situation. For CFS walls lined with gypsum plasterboard as the face layer and bolivian magnesium board as the base layer on both sides, different load ratios may result in different failure modes, and the fire resistance time would be more than 90 min when the load ratio was less than 0.65. It was also demonstrated that the fire performance of bolivian magnesium board was superior to that of the fire resistant gypsum plasterboard, therefore the former may be recommended to be used in CFS structures to replace gypsum plasterboards as the base layer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The fire performance of cold-formed steel members is an important criterion to be verified for their successful use in structural applications. However, lack of clear design guidance on their fire performance has inhibited their usage in buildings. Their elevated temperature mechanical properties, i.e., yield strengths, elastic moduli and stress–strain relationships, are imperative for the fire design. In the past many researchers have proposed elevated temperature mechanical property reduction factors for cold-formed steels, however, large variations exist among them. The LiteSteel Beam (LSB), a hollow flange channel section, is manufactured by a combined cold-forming and electric resistance welding process. Its web, inner and outer flange elements have different yield strengths due to varying levels of cold-working caused by their manufacturing process. Elevated temperature mechanical properties of LSBs are not the same even within their cross-sections. Therefore an experimental study was undertaken to determine the elevated temperature mechanical properties of steel plate elements in LSBs. Elevated temperature tensile tests were performed on web, inner and outer flange specimens taken from LSBs, and their results are presented in this paper including their comparisons with previous studies. Based on the test results and the proposed values from previous studies and fire design standards, suitable predictive equations are proposed for the determination of elevated temperature mechanical properties of LSB web and flange elements. Suitable stress–strain models are also proposed for the plate elements of this cold-formed and welded hollow flange channel section.},

Dehydration reaction of gypsum boards was investigated from both micro and macro levels, employing thermogravimetric analysis and a ventilated oven. A new dehydration mechanism of gypsum was proposed. The thermal properties of gypsum board such as enthalpy of reaction, specific heat capacity, and thermal conductivity were studied by differential scanning calorimetry and a heat transfer analyzer, respectively. The effect of void fraction and dehydration on thermal physical properties of gypsum board was investigated. The microstructure of the gypsum board at high temperature was studied with experiments and modeling. A model was proposed to describe the microstructure of a dehydrated system at high temperature, and experiments indicate its validity. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of gypsum at high temperature were investigated, and the effect of water content was discussed as well.

abstract = {In the present study, a fully coupled thermo-mechanical simulation methodology is presented, capable of estimating the response of cold-formed steel drywall systems exposed to fire and evaluating whether or not compliance with the performance-based fire safety requirements is achieved, in terms of the load-bearing capacity (R), integrity (E) and insulation (I) criteria. The proposed nonlinear coupled thermo-mechanical approach, accounting for geometry, material and contact nonlinearities, is validated against full-scale furnace test results of typical, commercially available, load-bearing drywall systems, achieving a very good qualitative and quantitative agreement; maximum discrepancies between the predicted and measured fire-resistance ratings do not exceed 2{\%}. Several parametric studies are carried out, concerning the magnitude of the imposed load on the bearing walls and the effect of the cavity insulation placement on the overall fire performance of drywall systems. It is found that installation of thermal insulation inside the drywall cavity may decrease the system's fire-resistance rating, depending on the employed configuration. The proposed numerical approach can be effectively used to estimate the fire-resistance rating of load-bearing lightweight steel drywall systems in support of performance-based fire design standards.},

In particular, the work addresses how does the temperature-dependence of the steel material behaviour, which is felt through both the (reduced) Young's modulus and nominal yield stress values, influences the quality (accuracy and safety) of the column ultimate strength predictions provided by the DSM distortional strength curve. Six different temperature-dependent steel constitutive laws are considered, namely (i) two models prescribed in part 1.2 of Eurocode 3 (EC3), for cold-formed and hot-rolled steel, and (ii) four experimentally-based analytical expressions recently reported in the literature. The DSM column ultimate strength estimates are compared with the numerical failure loads obtained through geometrically and physically non-linear Ansys shell finite element analyses incorporating critical-mode initial imperfections with small amplitudes.},

abstract = {Fire resistant and load bearing Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems are generally made of cold-formed steel stud sections lined with gypsum plasterboards. Structural stability of these steel frames at elevated temperatures is important for the load bearing LSF walls for survival during fire events. The studs in these frames are usually Lipped Channel Section (LCS) studs. However, there are other more structurally efficient stud sections such as the hollow flange section studs, which can be effectively used in LSF walls. However, lack of fire research on these sections has inhibited their usage in LSF walls. This paper proposes the use of hollow flange channel (HFC) section studs in LSF walls with a view to increase their fire resistant ratings (FRR). In this study, five full scale fire tests of LSF walls made of welded hollow flange channel section studs were conducted under standard fire conditions. Three different wall configurations and three load ratios were considered in these tests. This paper presents the details of fire tests and their results including the time-temperature profiles of plasterboard and steel stud surfaces, lateral displacement and axial deformation profiles, failure modes and failure temperatures. It also presents the effects of using different wall configurations and load ratios on the FRR of LSF walls. Comparison of the fire performance of LSF walls made of welded HFC section studs with those made of conventional LCS studs demonstrated the superior fire performance through the use of welded HFC section studs.},

abstract = {Summary An experimental program was performed for evaluating the seismic response and fragilities of nonstructural lightweight steel drywall partitions, also considering the interaction with structural elements and other nonstructural building components, ie, outdoor fa{\c{c}}ade walls. Therefore, in-plane quasi-static reversed cyclic tests were carried out on 8 specimens of indoor partition walls infilled in a frame and on 4 specimens of indoor partition walls connected at its ends with transversal outdoor fa{\c{c}}ade walls. Constructive parameters under investigation include type of connections used for connecting the indoor partition walls to the surrounding elements, stud spacing, type of sheathing panels, and type of jointing finishing. The effect of the constructive parameters on the lateral response in secant stiffness and strength is examined. Furthermore, the main damage phenomena observed during the tests are reported and associated to 3 damage limit states distinguished for the required repair level for the tested partition walls. Fragility curves are used for the experimental assessment of seismic fragility of the tested specimens, in accordance with the interstorey drift limits required by the European code. Finally, the quantitative estimation of the repair action costs starting from the damage observation is also developed. The obtained results could be considered a starting point for developing the in-plane seismic design assisted by testing of lightweight steel drywall partition walls.},

abstract = {The new useful concept of "Adiabatic Surface Temperature" or more commonly known as AST, introduced by Wickstr{\"{o}}m et al. in 2007, is investigated in this study. Adiabatic surface temperature can be used for bridging the gap between fire models and temperature models; for example, it offers the opportunity to transfer both thermal information of the gas and the net heat flux to the solid phase model, obtained by CFD analysis. In this study two numerical analyses are carried out in order to evaluate the effect of wall thermal conductivity and of convective heat transfer coefficient on the adiabatic surface temperature as thermal/structural parameter in fire modeling. First one CFD analysis simulating a fire scenario, "conjugate heat transfer", with a square beam exposed to hot surface, is carried out to calculate AST, convective heat transfer coefficient and temperature field in the beam. In the second one, a conductive analysis is carried out on "standalone beam" imposing a third type boundary condition on its boundaries assuming the AST, evaluated in the conjugate analysis, as external temperature. Different convective heat transfer coefficients are imposed on the beam walls; the beam is of concrete or steel. Results are presented in terms of net heat flux on beam surfaces, convective heat transfer coefficients and temperature profiles on the beam walls, temperature fields for the two, CFD and conductive, analyses and the relative temperature and net heat flux percent errors. Results underline that convective heat transfer coefficient profiles and adiabatic surface temperatures on the bottom and lateral beam walls are independent of the wall thermal conductivity value, whereas the net heat flux values increase as wall thermal conductivity increases, fixed the emissivity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The validated numerical model has been used to generate an extensive database (453) of numerical results of load carrying capacity of CF-TW members with different uniform and non-uniform temperature distributions in the cross-sections, under different boundary and loading conditions and with different dimensions and lengths. It is concluded that the existing DSM distortional buckling curve for ambient temperature application is also applicable for columns with uniform temperature distributions in the cross-section, but is un-conservative for columns with non-uniform temperature distributions in the cross-section.

The validated numerical model was used to generate an extensive database (372 models) of numerical results of load carry capacity of CF-TW members with different uniform and non-uniform temperature distributions in the cross-sections, under different boundary and loading conditions and with different dimensions and lengths. It was concluded that the DSM local buckling curve was directly applicable for columns with uniform temperature distributions in the cross-section. For columns with non-uniform temperature distributions, a modification to the local buckling curve was necessary and this paper has proposed a new curve.},

abstract = {In recent times, light gauge steel frame (LSF) wall systems are increasingly used in the building industry. They are usually made of cold-formed and thin-walled steel studs that are fire-protected by two layers of plasterboard on both sides. A composite LSF wall panel system was developed recently, where an insulation layer was used externally between the two plasterboards to improve the fire performance of LSF wall panels. In this research, finite element thermal models of the new composite panels were developed using a finite element program, SAFIR, to simulate their thermal performance under both standard and Eurocode design fire curves. Suitable apparent thermal properties of both the gypsum plasterboard and insulation materials were proposed and used in the numerical models. The developed models were then validated by comparing their results with available standard fire test results of composite panels. This paper presents the details of the finite element models of composite panels, the thermal analysis results in the form of time-temperature profiles under standard and Eurocode design fire curves and their comparisons with fire test results. Effects of using rockwool, glass fibre and cellulose fibre insulations with varying thickness and density were also investigated, and the results are presented in this paper. The results show that the use of composite panels in LSF wall systems will improve their fire rating, and that Eurocode design fires are likely to cause severe damage to LSF walls than standard fires.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {This report presents the results of an experimental study on the fire resistance of lightweight steel-framed (LSF) assemblies, conducted at the National Research Council of Canada in collaboration with industry partners. A total of 14 full-scale fire resistance tests were conducted on loadbearing gypsum board-protected, steel stud wall assemblies. The wall assemblies had either diagonal cross-bracing or shear membrane to enhance shear resistance to lateral loads. Both single row and double row steel stud configurations with installation of gypsum board on each of the fire exposed and unexposed sides were considered in the experimental program. The insulation used, within the wall assemblies, were glass, rock and dry-blown cellulose fibers. Some of the wall assemblies were provided with resilient channels, often used in wall designs to improve their sound transmission classification (STC) ratings, to study their effect on the fire resistance of steel stud walls. These tests were conducted to determine the effects of stud arrangement, crossbracing or shear membrane, load intensity, resilient channel installation, insulation type and thickness of studs on the fire resistance of gypsum board-protected, steel stud wall assemblies. Details of the results, including the temperatures and deflections measured during the fire resistance tests, are presented.

abstract = {The current design rules on bolted connections of cold-formed stainless steel structures are allowed for room (ambient) temperature condition only. Research on structural behavior of single shear bolted connections at elevated temperatures is limited. In this study, 100 single shear bolted connection specimens and 22 coupon specimens involving three different grades of stainless steel were conducted by using steady state test method in the temperature ranged from 200 to 950 °C. The three different grades of stainless steel are austenitic stainless steel EN 1.4301 (AISI 304) and EN 1.4571 (AISI 316Ti having small amount of titanium) as well as lean duplex stainless steel EN 1.4162 (AISI S32101). Furthermore, different bolts arrangement was also considered in the investigation. Two main failure modes were observed in the single shear bolted connection tests, namely the net section tension and bearing failures. The test results were compared with the predicted strengths calculated from the American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European Codes for cold-formed stainless steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties of stainless steel obtained at elevated temperatures were used. It is shown that the strengths of the single shear bolted connections predicted by the specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. A similar tendency of reduction was found when compared the reduction factor of material properties with that of the deterioration of the bolted connection test strengths with the corresponding type of cold-formed stainless steel at elevated temperatures. The austenitic stainless steel type EN 1.4571 (AISI 316Ti) generally performed better than the other two stainless steel types at elevated temperatures.},

The bottom boundary of the enclosure is treated as a series of isothermal rectangular elements with known temperatures that are measured experimentally. The temporal increase of temperature of the sensor which is centrally located at the upper boundary is calculated with the lumped capacitance method. The simulated temperature of the sensor is compared with the experimental data and good agreement is found for smaller air gaps.

Therefore, an extensive experimental study into the deterioration of mechanical properties for both low and high strength light gauge steels under elevated temperatures was conducted to derive accurate reduction factors for mechanical properties in fire safety design. This study included light gauge cold-formed steels with three steel grades and six thicknesses from 0.4 to 1.2 mm.

abstract = {This paper presents the results of an experimental and numerical investigation of temperature developments in sandwich panels consisting of steel sheeting and polyisocyanurate (PIR) core. Fire experiments were carried out on individual PIR sandwich panels and PIR sandwich panels with joint. The fire test results were used to validate a temperature dependent thermal conductivity model for PIR, through numerical heat transfer modelling using the general finite element package ABAQUS. The fire test results indicate that the temperatures at the joint on the unexposed side of a sandwich panel is initially lower than that on the panel. However, at high temperatures, the ablation of PIR core creates large gaps up to 25 mm. Due to high radiation within the gap, the joint temperature becomes much higher than the panel temperature. The results of a numerical parametric study indicate that if the joint gap can be controlled to be no greater than 5 mm, the joint and the panel temperatures on the unexposed surface would be similar. Joint gaps of 10 mm or greater would result in joint temperatures much higher than panel temperatures and would reduce the sandwich panel system insulation performance of less than 60 min even though the panel may be able to reach much longer standard fire resistance rating.},

abstract = {Gypsum plasterboard wall assemblies are extensively used as cladding material for walls, floors and ceilings, as well as a means for passive fire protection of timber structures. The good fire resistance characteristics of gypsum plasterboards are mainly owed to the gypsum “dehydration” process, occurring between 80 °C and 250 °C, where large quantities of energy are absorbed by evaporating water molecules, bound in the gypsum's crystal lattice. Aiming to enhance the prediction quality of numerical simulation tools, utilized to support the performance-based fire design of modern buildings, a gypsum dehydration numerical model is developed and validated. The model focuses on accurately describing the physical and chemical phenomena characterizing the gypsum dehydration process by employing a modelling approach based on solid reaction kinetics; temperature-dependent thermo-physical properties are also taken into account. The developed model is implemented in a Computational Fluid Dynamics code. Numerical results are validated by comparison to available temperature measurements obtained in a gypsum plasterboard wall assembly tested in a small-scale fire resistance furnace. Predictions of the developed model are found to agree reasonably well with the experimental data; a series of parametric studies is also performed aiming to investigate the effect of various modelling parameters.},

abstract = {Abstract. Fire resistance has become an important part in structural design due to the ever increasing loss of properties and lives every year. Conventionally the fire rating of load bearing Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) walls is determined using standard fire tests based on the time-temperature curve given in ISO 834 [1]. Full scale fire testing based on this standard time-temperature curve originated from the application of wood burning furnaces in the early 1900s and it is questionable whether it truly represents the fuel loads in modern buildings. Hence a detailed fire research study into the performance of LSF walls was undertaken using real design fires based on Eurocode parametric curves [2] and Barnett's ‘BFD' curves [3]. This paper presents the development of these real fire curves and the results of full scale experimental study into the structural and fire behaviour of load bearing LSF stud wall systems.},

abstract = {Fire safety of buildings has been recognised as very important by the building industry and the community at large. Traditionally, increased fire rating is provided by simply adding more plasterboards to light gauge steel frame (LSF) walls, which is inefficient. Many research studies have been undertaken to investigate the thermal behaviour of traditional LSF stud wall systems under standard fire conditions. However, no research has been undertaken on the thermal behaviour of LSF stud walls using the recently proposed composite panel. Extensive fire testing of both non-load bearing and load bearing wall panels was conducted in this research based on the standard time-temperature curve in AS1530.4. Three groups of LSF wall specimens were tested with no insulation, cavity insulation and the new composite panel based on an external insulation layer between plasterboards. This paper presents the details of this experimental study into the thermal performance of non-load bearing walls lined with various configurations of plasterboard and insulation. Extensive descriptive and numerical results of the tested non-load bearing wall panels given in this paper provide a thorough understanding of their thermal behaviour, and valuable time-temperature data that can be used to validate numerical models. Test results showed that the innovative composite stud wall systems outperformed the traditional stud wall systems in terms of their thermal performance, giving a much higher fire rating.},

abstract = {Light gauge steel framed (LSF) walls are used in fire compartmentation to prevent the spread of fire, smoke and toxic gases. The fire behavioural characteristics of non-load bearing LSF walls are different from those of load bearing walls. In non-load bearing LSF walls, fire penetration to the ambient side is to be prevented for insulation and integrity criteria whereas in load bearing walls, steel studs need to be protected from heat for structural adequacy also. This paper investigates the fire resistance of non-load bearing and load bearing LSF walls with and without cavity insulation. It presents the details of a series of standard fire tests conducted to investigate the effect of cavity insulation in both load bearing and non-load bearing LSF walls. The use of cavity insulation increased the fire resistance level (FRL) of non-load bearing walls, while it significantly reduced the FRL of load bearing walls. A finite element parametric study was then conducted for LSF walls lined with both single and double layers of plasterboards. Both thermal and structural fire performance results of LSF walls from finite element analyses are presented and compared in this paper. These results showed that FRL of cavity insulated non-load bearing LSF walls increases by 10–20 min, while it is significantly reduced for load bearing LSF walls with load ratios below 0.7. This study highlights both the beneficial and detrimental effects of cavity insulated LSF walls exposed to fire.},

abstract = {A review of height extrapolation methods used in the past, by BRANZ, has shown that complex techniques based on temperature rises inducing deflections, curvature and detachment of studs from channels can be reduced to a simple empirical formula. Given that a wall system comprising a certain stud and lining configuration has to be proven by a fire resistance test, a premise that the same or closely similar thermal and structural conditions will be reproduced within the wall is the basis of the proposed method. Four key features (of height, stud depth, lining and temperature difference across the studs) affecting the general performance of a wall were examined to determine some key dependencies and isolate irrelevant parameters from further consideration. This approach was possible by taking a macroscopic view of a system as a whole, and by assuming for all height and stud depth combinations of a given system that the behaviour is similar and predictable to a high degree.

abstract = {Light gauge steel frame (LSF) floor systems are generally made of lipped channel section joists and lined with gypsum plasterboards to provide adequate fire resistance rating under fire conditions. Recently a new LSF floor system made of welded hollow flange channel (HFC) section was developed and its fire performance was investigated using full scale fire tests. The new floor systems gave higher fire resistance ratings in comparison to conventional LSF floor systems. To avoid expensive and time consuming full scale fire tests, finite element analyses were also performed to simulate the fire performance of LSF floors made of HFC joists using both steady and transient state methods. This paper presents the details of the developed finite element models of HFC joists to simulate the structural fire performance of the LSF floor systems under standard fire conditions. Finite element analyses were performed using the measured timeerature profiles of the failed joists from the fire tests, and their failure times, temperatures and modes, and deflection versus time curves were obtained. The developed finite element models successfully predicted the structural performance of LSF floors made of HFC joists under fire conditions. They were able to simulate the complex behaviour of thin cold-formed steel joists subjected to non-uniform temperature distributions, and local buckling and yielding effects. This study also confirmed the superior fire performance of the newly developed LSF floors made of HFC joists.},

abstract = {Although a few fire experiments have been carried out on load-bearing cold-formed steel (CFS) wall systems, the understanding of their fire performance is still limited, and further parametric analysis on the basis of such experiments is expensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a simplified numerical approach to predicting the thermal and mechanical responses of CFS wall systems in fire. Thermal physical property experiments were carried out to measure the essential material properties. With those material properties as inputs, a one-dimensional thermal response model was developed to predict the heat transfer across the cross section of CFS wall systems. Both heat convection and radiation were considered in the thermal boundary conditions. The governing equation was expressed in the form of implicit finite-differential equations and solved using the Gauss-Seidel method. The model predictions of temperature responses of CFS wall systems were in good agreement with the measured temperature responses in the fire experiments and also compared well with the modeling results in literature with improved efficiency and convergence in computation. In addition, a thermomechanical response model was developed to predict the time-dependent lateral deflection and fire resistance time for CFS wall systems in fire and was validated by the experimental results in literature. All these studies provide an efficient approach for the fire performance analysis of load-bearing CFS wall systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {The importance of fire safety design has been realised due to the ever increasing loss of properties and lives caused by structural failures during fires. In recognition of the importance of fire safety design, extensive research has been undertaken in the field of fire safety of buildings and structures especially over the last couple of decades. In the same period, the development of fire safety engineering principles has brought significant reduction to the cost of fire protection. However the past fire research on steel structures has been limited to heavier, hot-rolled structural steel members and thus the structural behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel members under fire conditions is not well understood. Since cold-formed steel structures have been commonly used for numerous applications and their use has increased rapidly in the last decade, the fire safety of cold-formed steel structural members has become an important issue. The current design standards for steel structures have simply included a list of reduction factors for the yield strength and elasticity modulus of hot-rolled steels without any detailed design procedures. It is not known whether these reduction factors are applicable to the commonly used thin, high strength steels in Australia. Further, the local buckling effects dominate the structural behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel members. Therefore an extensive research program was undertaken at the Queensland University of Technology to investigate the local buckling behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel compression members under simulated fire conditions. $\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe first phase of this research program included 189 tensile coupon tests including three steel grades and six thicknesses to obtain the accurate yield strength and elasticity modulus values at elevated temperatures because the deterioration of the mechanical properties is the major parameter in the structural design under fire conditions. The results obtained from the tensile tests were used to predict the ultimate strength of cold-formed steel members. An appropriate stress-strain model was also developed by considering the inelastic mechanical characteristics.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe second phase of this research was based on a series of more than 120 laboratory experiments and corresponding numerical analyses on cold-formed steel compression members to investigate the local bucking behaviour of the unstiffened flange elements, stiffened web elements and stiffened web and flange elements at elevated temperatures up to 800°C. The conventional effective design rules were first simply modified considering the reduced mechanical properties obtained from the tensile coupon tests and their adequacy was studied using the experimental and numerical results. It was found that the simply modified effective width design rules were adequate for low strength steel members and yet was not adequate for high strength cold-formed steel members due to the severe reduction of the ultimate strength in the post buckling strength range and the severe reduction ratio of the elasticity modulus to the yield strength at elevated temperatures. Due to the inadequacy of the current design rules, the theoretical, semi-empirical and empirical effective width design rules were developed to accurately predict the ultimate strength of cold-formed steel compression members subject to local buckling effects at elevated temperatures. The accuracy of these new design methods was verified by comparing their predictions with a variety of experimental and numerical results. $\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis thesis presents the details of extensive experimental and numerical studies undertaken in this research program and the results including comparison with simply modified effective width design rules. It also describes the advanced finite element models of cold-formed steel compression members developed in this research including the appropriate mechanical properties, initial imperfections, residual stresses and other significant factors. Finally, it presents the details of the new design methods proposed for the cold-formed steel compression members subject to local buckling effects at elevated temperatures.},

The paper also explains how to use the software at its full extent. The discussed numerical modeling principles can be applied with other similar software. Design/methodology/approach Following a general overview of the organization of the software, the thermal analysis part is explained, with the basic equations and the different possibilities to apply thermal boundary conditions (compartment fire, localized fire, etc.). Next, the mechanical analysis part is detailed, including the time integration procedures and the different types of finite elements: beam, truss, shell, spring and solid. Finally, the material laws are described. The software capabilities and limitations are discussed throughout the paper. Findings By accommodating multiple types of finite elements and materials, by allowing the user to consider virtually any section type and to input the fire attack in multiple forms, the software SAFIR{\textregistered} is a comprehensive tool for investigating the behavior of structures in the fire situation. Meanwhile, being developed exclusively for its well-defined field of application, it remains relatively easy to use. Originality value The paper will improve the knowledge of readers (researchers, designers and authorities) about numerical modeling used in structural fire engineering in general and the capabilities of a particular software largely used in the fire engineering community.},

A limited study on circular HSCFT beam-columns, presented in this thesis, was conducted to obtain additional experimental data on the behavior of these structural elements and assess recent design code provisions with regard to circular concrete filled tube (CFT) columns. Three long beam-columns {\$}(L/D=13.5){\$} were tested under constant axial compression and incrementally increasing lateral displacement reversals. The level of the axial load was the main parameter investigated in this experiment. In addition, one short column was tested in concentric compression. All specimens had the same cross-sectional geometry to allow for direct comparison. Both strength and deformability issues were addressed. Various aspects of concrete confinement in circular CFTs were analyzed. A comparative study of North American and European design code provisions was carried out. The experimental results were compared with theoretical predictions of strength. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)},

Aiming to investigate the impact of gypsum dehydration in full-scale CFD simulations of lightweight drywall buildings, the FDS code is used to simulate a two-storey residential building, exposed to a typical domestic fire scenario. The building employs a structural steel frame combined with gypsum plasterboard wall assemblies. Temperature-dependent thermo-physical properties are used for all construction materials. The effects of gypsum dehydration are assessed by using two alternative modelling approaches, an effective specific heat model and a solid reaction kinetics model; the obtained predictions are compared to a benchmark test case, where no such phenomena are modelled. The obtained results demonstrate that when the highly endothermic gypsum dehydration phenomena are simulated, lower overall heat release rates, gas and wall surface temperatures are predicted. In addition, the developed solid reaction kinetics model allows, for the first time, quantitative predictions of gypsum dehydration induced water vapour production and dispersion phenomena.},

abstract = {This paper presents the full-scale experimental assessment of a log-house timber wall with partial thermal insulation under in-plane compression and exposed to fire on one side. A key aspect of the current design application for log-house systems is represented by geometrical details, like cross-sectional properties of logs (typically characterised by high depth-to-width ratios) and outriggers. The latter provides restraint condition for the examined walls and hence markedly affects their overall load-carrying capacity. As a result, careful consideration should be given to the choice of these details, compared to fully monolithic timber walls (i.e., made from cross-laminated timber), due to the possible occurrence of local structural and/or thermo-mechanical mechanisms. This is the case of exceptional loading conditions like fire load, as the fire resistance of these systems could be affected by a multitude of variables, including the presence (even though limited to few surfaces only) of thermal insulation panels. To this aim, the results of a full-scale furnace test are discussed in the paper for a log-wall with partial thermal insulation, namely thermal insulation applied on the outriggers only, under the effects of EN/ISO standard fire conditions. The results of Finite Element (FE) numerical studies are also reported, to further explore the load-carrying performance of the reference log-house specimen and compare it with the experimental observations. Several thermal insulation configurations are finally numerically investigated, showing their effects on the overall fire resistance of the assembly. In accordance with literature, the test shows that the log house's timber wall is suitable to obtain a fire resistance of about 60 min under relevant loading. The FE results are in rather close agreement with the temperature measurements within the section of logs, as well as a qualitative correlation with respect to the mechanical behaviour observed in the full-scale furnace experiment. The key role of outriggers and their thermo-mechanical boundaries, finally, is emphasised.},

abstract = {Recent fire research into the behaviour of light gauge steel frame (LSF) wall systems has developed fire design rules based on Australian and European cold-formed steel design standards, AS/NZS 4600 and Eurocode 3 Part 1.3. However, these design rules are complex since the LSF wall studs are subjected to non-uniform elevated temperature distributions when the walls are exposed to fire from one side. Therefore this paper proposes an alternative design method for routine predictions of fire resistance rating of LSF walls. In this method, suitable equations are recommended first to predict the idealised stud time-temperature profiles of eight different LSF wall configurations subject to standard fire conditions based on full scale fire test results. A new set of equations was then proposed to find the critical hot flange (failure) temperature for a given load ratio for the same LSF wall configurations with varying steel grades and thickness. These equations were developed based on detailed finite element analyses that predicted the axial compression capacities and failure times of LSF wall studs subject to non-uniform temperature distributions with varying steel grades and thicknesses. This paper proposes a simple design method in which the two sets of equations developed for time-temperature profiles and critical hot flange temperatures are used to find the failure times of LSF walls. The proposed method was verified by comparing its predictions with the results from full scale fire tests and finite element analyses. This paper presents the details of this study including the finite element models of LSF wall studs, the results from relevant fire tests and finite element analyses, and the proposed equations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel members are widely used in load bearing Light gauge steel frame (LSF) wall systems with plasterboard linings on both sides. However, these thin-walled steel sections heat up quickly and lose their strength under fire conditions despite the protection provided by plasterboards. Hence there is a need for simple fire design rules to predict their load capacities and fire resistance ratings. During fire events, the LSF wall studs are subjected to non-uniform temperature distributions that cause thermal bowing, neutral axis shift and magnification effects and thus resulting in a combined axial compression and bending action on the LSF wall studs. In this research a series of full scale fire tests was conducted first to evaluate the performance of LSF wall systems with eight different wall configurations under standard fire conditions. Finite element models of LSF walls were then developed, analysed under transient and steady state conditions, and validated using full scale fire tests. Using the results from fire tests and finite element analyses, a detailed investigation was undertaken into the prediction of axial compression strength and failure times of LSF wall studs in standard fires using the available fire design rules based on Australian, American and European standards. The results from both fire tests and finite element analyses were used to investigate the ability of these fire design rules to include the complex effects of non-uniform temperature distributions and their accuracy in predicting the axial compression strengths of wall studs and the failure times. Suitable modifications were then proposed to the fire design rules. This paper presents the details of this investigation into the accuracy of using currently available fire design rules of LSF walls and the results.},

abstract = {The demand for lightweight materials in construction has become very popular due to its flexibility and economical importance. Cold-formed steel beams and columns are used for provision of lightweight, durable and cost-efficient structures, and its usage also helps to optimize the construction time. Cold-formed steel section exhibits post-buckling strength, in which hot rolled section is deficient. However, more theoretical background on design and behavior of cold form section is still required, especially when it is subjected to axial loading. Thus, this paper presents numerical and theoretical behavior of pin -jointed cold-formed steel (CFS) column section (built-up battened Lip channel) under axial loading. The numerical modeling was done by using ABAQUS 6.10 software. Based on American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) specifications, two types of sections were selected for single lipped channel, and it was ensured that the selected chord spacing permits both moment of inertia about the major axis and minor axis are equal. The numerical and theoretical study were done using a varying batten number and section slenderness ratio. The ultimate loads were obtained under the two approaches, for the lipped channel built-up columns, and were compared for the effective section proposed. From the results, the prediction of buckling mode and the failure load of the column were found to be stable and approximately relevant to the FEM results from slenderness ratio ranging from 20 to 60. Also, flexural buckling of all column sections occurred about the axis parallel to the webs, where there is an opportunity for composite action.},

abstract = {Fire safety has become an important part in structural design due to the ever increasing loss of properties and lives during fires. Fire rating of load bearing wall systems made of Light gauge Steel Frames (LSF) is determined using fire tests based on the standard time-temperature curve given in ISO 834. However, modern residential buildings make use of thermoplastic materials, which mean considerably high fuel loads. Hence a detailed fire research study into the performance of load bearing LSF walls was undertaken using a series of realistic design fire curves developed based on Eurocode parametric curves and Barnett's BFD curves. It included both full scale fire tests and numerical studies of LSF walls without any insulation, and the recently developed externally insulated composite panels. This paper presents the details of fire tests first, and then the numerical models of tested LSF wall studs. It shows that suitable finite element models can be developed to predict the fire rating of load bearing walls under real fire conditions. The paper also describes the structural and fire performances of externally insulated LSF walls in comparison to the non-insulated walls under real fires, and highlights the effects of standard and real fire curves on fire performance of LSF walls.},

abstract = {This paper assesses the applicability of the Direct Strength Method (DSM) to calculating the local buckling ultimate strength of cold-formed thin-walled (CF-TW) steel members with non-uniform elevated temperature distributions in the cross-section. The assessment was carried out by checking the DSM calculation results with numerical simulation results using the general finite element software ABAQUS which was validated against ambient and uniform elevated temperature tests on short lipped channel sections. The validated numerical model was used to generate an extensive database (372 models) of numerical results of load carry capacity of CF-TW members with different uniform and non-uniform temperature distributions in the cross-sections, under different boundary and loading conditions and with different dimensions and lengths. It was concluded that the DSM local buckling curve was directly applicable for columns with uniform temperature distributions in the cross-section. For columns with non-uniform temperature distributions, a modification to the local buckling curve was necessary and this paper has proposed a new curve. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cold-formed steel wall frame systems using lipped or unlipped C-sections and gypsum plasterboard lining are commonly utilised in the construction of both the load bearing and non-load bearing walls in the residential, commercial and industrial buildings. However, the structural behaviour of unlined and lined stud wall frames is not well understood and adequate design rules are not available. A detailed research program was therefore undertaken to investigate the behaviour of stud wall frame systems. As the first step in this research, the problem relating to the degree of end fixity of stud was investigated. The studs are usually connected to the top and bottom tracks and the degree of end fixity provided by these tracks is not adequately addressed by the design codes. A finite element model of unlined frames was therefore developed, and validated using full scale experimental results. It was then used in a detailed parametric study to develop appropriate design rules for unlined wall frames. This study has shown that by using appropriate effective length factors, the ultimate load and failure modes of the unlined studs can be accurately predicted using the provisions of Australian or American cold-formed steel structures design codes. This paper presents the details of the finite element analyses, the results and recommended design rules for unlined wall frames. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this study the new useful concept of “Adiabatic Surface Temperature” or more commonly known as AST, introduced by Wickstr{\"{o}}m, is investigated. The adiabatic surface temperature offers the opportunity to transfer both thermal information of the gas and the net heat flux to the solid phase model, obtained by CFD analysis. In this study two CFD analyses are carried out in order to evaluate the effect of emissivity and of convective heat transfer coefficient to determine the AST. First one CFD analysis simulating a fire scenario, “conjugate heat transfer”, with a square steel beam exposed to hot surface is carried out to calculate AST, heat convective coefficient and temperature field in the beam. Second one, a conductive analysis is carried out on “standalone beam” imposing a third type boundary condition on its boundaries assuming the AST, evaluated in the conjugate analysis, as external temperature. Different heat convective coefficients are imposed on the beam walls. The comparison between results obtained by means of the two proposed analyses shows the use of AST as transfer thermal parameter between CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) and FEM (Finite Element Method) models is appropriate when the convective heat transfer coefficient is properly evaluated.},

abstract = {Lightweight steel framing (LSF), assembled from thin gauge cold formed steel members, is increasingly popular in commercial and residential construction in North America because of its non-combustibility, dimensional stability, ease of installation and other advantageous features. In many instances, LSF wall and floor assemblies are required to serve as fire compartment boundaries and provide adequate fire resistance, with the purpose of preventing (or delaying) the spread of fire and ensuring that building integrity is maintained while occupants evacuate and fire fighters perform suppression and rescue operations. Existing codes require the fire resistance ratings of structural assemblies to be determined on the basis of standard fire resistance tests, which are quite expensive and time consuming. As a result, in Canada, the number of LSF assemblies tested for fire resistance is extremely limited compared to the variety of designs that LSF technology can offer. The experimental part of this research thesis adds to the existing database on the fire resistance of loadbearing LSF walls protected with two layers of fire resistant gypsum board by presenting detailed results of three new tests. These tests were designed to complement earlier experiments and investigate the effect of stud spacing, cavity insulation and resilient channels on the fire resistance of loadbearing LSF walls, Test results indicate that, contrary to generally held beliefs, cavity insulation and resilient channels reduce the fire resistance of loadbearing LSF walls while increased stud spacing does not. In addition to standard instrumentation used in fire resistance tests, more than 50 thermocouples and ten deflection gauges were used in each test to generate temperature and deformation data suitable for analytical studies. The analytical part of this research thesis is devoted to the development and calibration of numerical modelling techniques in retrospective simulations of six wall tests and five floor tests. This task included the development of computer program TRACE for thermal simulations and computer programs STUD and JOIST for structural simulations. Theoretical structural models, presented in this thesis, form the basis of the latter two programs. Both thermal and structural simulations showed a reasonable agreement with experimental data.},

abstract = {OpenSees, an open source finite element software framework, has been used broadly in the earthquake engineering community for simulating the seismic response of structural and geotechnical systems. The framework allows users to perform finite element analysis with a scripting language and for developers to create both serial and parallel finite element computer applications as interpreters. For the last 15 years, Tcl has been the primary scripting language to which the model building and analysis modules of OpenSees are linked. To provide users with different scripting language options, particularly Python, the OpenSees interpreter interface was refactored to provide multi-interpreter capabilities. This refactoring, resulting in the creation of OpenSeesPy as a Python module, is accomplished through an abstract interface for interpreter calls with concrete implementations for different scripting languages. Through this approach, users are able to develop applications that utilize the unique features of several scripting languages while taking advantage of advanced finite element analysis models and algorithms.},

abstract = {Worldwide, cold-formed thin-walled steel members have been widely used as primary load bearing members, such as wall studs, floor joints, columns and beams, in low to medium-rise buildings such as offices, hotels, flat blocks and houses. A potential problem of using cold-formed thin-walled steel in building structures is fire exposure. Steel has high thermal conductivity and thin-walled sections have high section factors, both leading to rapid steel temperature rises in fire. Despite their increasing use, our understanding of the performance of cold-formed thin-walled steel sections in fire has been limited, mainly to the standard fire resistance testing by manufacturers of cold-formed thin-walled steel sections. Such a practice is expensive and time-consuming and it is difficult to develop fundamental understanding of thin-walled steel structural behaviour in fire. Against this background, this thesis presents the results of a major experimental and numerical study of cold-formed thin-walled steel structures in fire. It includes the thermal performance of thin-walled steel channel sections in planar systems under fire attack from one side, the axial strength of cold-formed thin-walled channel sections and rectangular hollow sections at ambient and under high temperature conditions, and the axial strength of cold-formed thin-walled steel channel section panels under fire expose from one side. This project includes both experimental and numerical studies. The experiments include fire testing of eight small steel stud panels (300x300mm) with different types of steel section (lipped channel or unlipped channel), different numbers of gypsum boards (one layer or two layers) and either with or without interior insulation; 52 tests on short cold-formed lipped and unlipped channels at ambient and various elevated temperatures; and eight tests on full-scale steel stud panels (2200x200mm), two at ambient temperature and six under fire. The numerical studies of this project include an assessment of different design methods, ABAQUS simulation of various tests and numerical parametric studies of different systems. Modifications have been made to enable BS5950 Part 5 (BSI 1998) and ENV 1993-1-3 (CEN 2001) to predict the ultimate strength of thin-walled columns with service holes, and to extend the ability of BS5950 Part 5 (BSI 1998), ENV 1993-1-3 (CEN 2001) and AISI (1996) to deal with distortional buckling failure and the change in the strength and stiffness of steel at uniform elevated temperatures. For columns with non-uniform temperature profiles, the ambient temperature design method for cold-formed thin-walled columns in ENV 1993-1-3 (CEN 2001) is also modified to take into account the thermal bowing effects. The finite element program ABAQUS (HKS 2001) has been validated first against the test results. The validated software is used to carry out a number of parametric studies to investigate the performance of different systems, including thermal performance of steel stud and cassette systems with different numbers of gypsum boards on the exposed and unexposed sides; structural behaviour of short cold-formed thin-walled channel columns; structural performance of rectangular hollow columns of different lengths under uniform high temperatures, but with different initial imperfections; and structural performance of cold-formed thin-walled columns under non-uniform high temperatures. The results presented in this thesis should be valuable to both users and researchers of fire safety engineering and the cold-formed steel industry.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel stud sections are commonly used as compression members in fire rated load-bearing light gauge steel frame (LSF) wall systems. Although conventional lipped channel section (LCS) studs are commonly used in LSF wall systems, there is a growing interest in developing innovative stud sections to increase the load carrying capacities when used in fire rated LSF wall systems. One such section is the web-stiffened section (WSS), which has increased load carrying capacities as well as enhanced acoustic properties. However, the applicability of the existing structural fire design rules has not been investigated for the WSS stud sections while the advantages of using such sections have not been demonstrated. Therefore, the structural behaviour of WSS stud sections was investigated under ambient and fire conditions using finite element analyses and their capacities were compared with those of conventional LCS studs. Three different LSF wall configurations and three stud thicknesses were considered for both stud sections. The applicability of existing structural fire design rules for LCS and WSS studs used in fire rated LSF wall systems was then investigated based on finite element analyses, effective width method and direct strength method. The results show that WSS studs have much higher load carrying capacities than LCS studs under ambient and fire conditions and that direct strength method based design rules are simpler to use than the effective width based design rules for the structural fire design of LSF wall systems made of both LCS and WSS studs. This paper presents the details of this investigation and the results.},

abstract = {The aim of this literature review is to explore how music therapy influences the behaviour of older people with dementia. Music therapy is often informally used in residential care units to enhance communication, emotional, cognitive and behavioural skills in elderly patients diagnosed with dementia both nationally and internationally. However, in Ireland the benefits of music therapy have not been fully recognized. Many studies have been carried out to establish the effectiveness of music therapy on the behaviour of older people with dementia with positive findings. Music therapy should be welcomed into care of the elderly settings in Ireland and elsewhere; however, more research is required to validate the effects of this therapy as a holistic tool to build altruistic connections between carers and clients. A comprehensive review of nursing literature using the online databases CINAHL, PsycINFO and MEDLINE were carried out. The search was limited to articles in the English language and peer-reviewed journals dating 2003-2009. Thirteen studies were reviewed and the majority of these studies reported that music therapy influenced the behaviour of older people with dementia in a positive way by reducing levels of agitation. The research further identified a positive increase in participants' mood and socialization skills, with carers having a significant role to play in the use of music therapy in care of the elderly nursing. However, methodological limitations were apparent throughout each of the studies reviewed. With reference to clinical practice, the authors recommend the undertaking of further research to explore the effects of music therapy on the behaviour and wellbeing of older people with dementia.},

abstract = {Coupled CFD fire simulations and thermomechanical FE analyses typically consist of fire simulations, heat transfer analyses and structural response analyses, mutually coupled by three coupling steps. There are two coupling approaches, one-way and two-way coupling, where two-way coupling includes the effects of the structural response on fire propagation. In the first part of this paper, one- and two-way coupling approaches including the coupling steps are proposed to include coupling at the structural level. Then a case study comprising an office space with a 12-plate thin-walled steel fa{\c{c}}ade under fire conditions is introduced, as well as the related CFD and FE models. A newly developed automated coupling interface and subprograms are used to perform several one-way and two-way coupled analyses using a coarse and fine CFD mesh for the case study. Slight differences are found in the results of identical simulations due to random effects in the fire simulations. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that two-way coupling is feasible, and that significant differences in the fa{\c{c}}ade failure progression illustrate its effectiveness. Future research includes additional developments of both the fire and structural models, as well as verification and parametric studies to further confirm the findings.},

The objective of this paper is to detail a newly developed imperfection measurement platform, where the full-three dimensional (3D) imperfect geometry of a cold-formed steel member can be measured and reconstructed with reasonably high throughput and sufficient accuracy to explore all relevant imperfections. The measurement platform is composed of a two-dimensional laser sensor mounted on rotary and linear stages. Specimens are placed within a rotary ring and along a reference beam. The linear stage provides a means to scan the length of the specimen and the rotary stage a means to scan from any angle. Control of the custom linear and rotary stages are detailed in the paper, and corresponding control accuracies are studied. A procedure for registering the individual scans into the complete 3D model reconstruction (point cloud) is provided by specific calibration tests, from which rotation and translation quantities can be found to transform surfaces measured in local coordinates to a universal global coordinate system. A variety of different imperfection quantities, from basic dimensions and out-of-plane deviations to more advanced spectral and modalbased imperfection magnitudes may be rapidly processed from the 3D model. Accurate understanding of geometric imperfections is critical to the long-term success of analysis-based design paradigms for cold-formed steel constructions. The apparatus detailed herein will be used to provide a broad suite of imperfection information to assist in these new efforts.},

Previous studies were mainly to investigate the fire performance of non-load bearing CFS wall systems lined with gypsum plasterboards. In order to improve the fire performance of load-bearing CFS wall systems more efficiently, this paper presented a detailed experimental investigation on five full-scale CFS walls lined with double layers of three different fire resistant panels on both sides, including fire-resistant gypsum plasterboard, bolivian magnesium board and calcium silicate board. The results showed a noticeable disadvantage of the calcium silicate board due to explosive spalling at high temperatures, and this might cause severe safety issues in an actual fire situation. For CFS walls lined with gypsum plasterboard as the face layer and bolivian magnesium board as the base layer on both sides, different load ratios may result in different failure modes, and the fire resistance time would be more than 90 min when the load ratio was less than 0.65. It was also demonstrated that the fire performance of bolivian magnesium board was superior to that of the fire resistant gypsum plasterboard, therefore the former may be recommended to be used in CFS structures to replace gypsum plasterboards as the base layer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their thermal properties and fire performance have not been fully investigated. Therefore, in this research study thermal properties of two different types of MgO boards available in Australia were measured and their fire performance was investigated using three full-scale fire tests of LSF walls lined with two types of MgO board. Although the tests were conducted on two different types of MgO boards with different configurations, the fire test results gave a fire resistance level (FRL) of 30 min, in which the failure was initiated by integrity of the board with either board cracking or board joint opening. This paper presents the details of the thermal property tests and the three full-scale fire tests, and their results. In addition, the effects of different MgO boards, joint configurations and compounds, noggings, screw fastening techniques and cavity insulation on the fire performance of LSF walls are also presented.},

The temperature distribution in the web-post was non-uniform, even for the unprotected CSB and the fully protected CSB. The fire resistance time of a CSB increased linearly with the increase in fire coating thickness. However, for the partially protected cellular steel beam, the temperature gradient in the web-post becomes greater with the increase in the fire protection thickness. And with the increase in the fire protection thickness, the increment in the fire resistance time decreased. Additional thermal stress occurred due to the non-uniform thermal strain in the web-post. When web-post buckled, the principle compression stress in the web-post decreased suddenly. The stress at the center of the web-post could change from compression to tension due to the membrane action caused by the large buckling deformation.},

abstract = {External flaming from buildings occurs as a result of a large amount of fuel being available in the room of fire origin in comparison to the amount of ventilation provided. The size of the openings in a compartment affects the amount of oxygen available within the fire room, and hence the amount of combustion that can take place inside. Excess fuel that is not burnt within the room flows out of the opening and combusts upon reaching the oxygen in the air outside. It is in this situation that flames are seen projecting out of the window. Flames projecting from openings pose the threat of fire spread from the room of fire origin. This threat increases with the size of the flames. Thus a dependable method for predicting the size of flames projecting from openings is required. This research addresses the issue of predicting flame heights projecting from openings, based on the heat release rate of a fire. The results are based on laboratory experiments and are presented in non-dimensional form, allowing application to scenarios that have not been specifically tested. This work supports the findings of other researchers, with appropriate adjustments made to compensate for differing experimental approaches. This indicates that the relationships established between the non-dimensional heat release rate and flame height are formed from a sound underlying principle. An empirical relationship between the non-dimensional flame height and heat release rate of a fire is presented in a simplified format to enable ease of use. The temperatures attained, and other observations from the compartment fire experiments are also presented and discussed. These were found to have dependence on a number of factors, with relationships varying between the individual experiments. The widely-used computational fluid dynamics model Fire Dynamics Simulator, Version 4 (FDS), was found to currently be unreliable in modelling the experimental scenarios. The results obtained were unrealistic and bore minimal resemblance to the experimental results, with extensive computational simulation time. The ability of the programme to model the compartment fire scenario requires further investigation to determine whether a finer grid resolution may improve results, or whether it is simply not able to model combustion processes involved at this stage.},

abstract = {Current design standards do not provide adequate guidelines for the fire design of cold-formed steel compression members subject to flexural-torsional buckling. Eurocode 3 Part 1.2 (2005) recommends the same fire design guidelines for both hot-rolled and cold-formed steel compression members subject to flexural-torsional buckling although considerable behavioural differences exist between cold-formed and hot-rolled steel members. Past research has recommended the use of ambient temperature cold-formed steel design rules for the fire design of cold-formed steel compression members provided appropriately reduced mechanical properties are used at elevated temperatures. To assess the accuracy of flexural-torsional buckling design rules in both ambient temperature cold-formed steel design and fire design standards, an experimental study of slender cold-formed steel compression members was undertaken at both ambient and elevated temperatures. This paper presents the details of this experimental study, its results, and their comparison with the predictions from the current design rules. It was found that the current ambient temperature design rules are conservative while the fire design rules are overly conservative. Suitable recommendations have been made in relation to the currently available design rules for flexural-torsional buckling including methods of improvement. Most importantly, this paper has addressed the lack of experimental results for slender cold-formed steel columns at elevated temperatures.},

Tested fire resistance ratings are generally available for non-loadbearing LSF drywall systems lined with gypsum plasterboard. No test information exists for loadbearing systems. Current solutions are based on limiting steel temperature. This study investigates the parameters which affect the performance of loadbearing LSF drywall systems exposed to fire. Structural design codes for cold-formed steel members are compared. Methods are presented for calculating the reduction of steel strength and stiffness at elevated temperatures, and for predicting the deformations resulting from temperature gradients and P-∆ effects. Heat transfer modelling by computer is used to predict steel framing temperatures for systems exposed to the standard ISO834 time-temperature curve and real fires. Three full-scale furnace tests were carried out to evaluate analytical predictions. A model is proposed for predicting the performance of loadbearing LSF systems exposed to fire. Results are within 80-90{\%} of test results. The current practice of designing to a limiting steel temperature results in unduly conservative predictions, particularly for systems with low applied axial loads. It was also found that fire tests may give non-conservative results for systems with low stud loads due to frictional restraints.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to provide and verify simplified models that predict the longitudinal stresses that develop in C-section purlins in uplift. The paper begins with the simple case of flexural stress; where the force has to be applied at the shear center, or the section braced in both flanges. Restrictions on load application point and restraint of the flanges are removed until arriving at the more complex problem of bending when movement of the tension flange alone is restricted, as commonly found in purlin-sheeting systems. Winter's model for predicting the longitudinal stresses developed due to direct torsion is reviewed, verified, and then extended to cover the case of a bending member with tension flange restraint. The developed longitudinal stresses from flexure and restrained torsion are used to assess the elastic stability behavior of typical purlin-sheeting systems. Finally, strength predictions of typical C-section purlins are provided for existing AISI methods and a newly proposed extension to the direct strength method that employs the predicted longitudinal stress distributions within the strength prediction. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cold-formed steel studs are often used in lightweight partition walls to provide structural stability but in the same time they change the acoustic performance of the whole system. The overall design of such lightweight structures for acoustic sound insulation becomes very complicated as the sound passing through stud needs to be quantified. One of the greatest challenges is to characterize the stud's geometric effects on the sound transmission of the partition walls. This paper presents a 2-D Finite Element modelling approach and results into the vibro-acoustic performance of different studs in double-leaf walls which are placed in between a reverberant source room and a receiving room. The acoustic medium inside rooms was modelled using fluid elements and the structure was modelled with plane strain elements. The interaction between the acoustic medium and the structure was modelled in a coupled structural-acoustic analysis. An FE modelling setup which includes appropriate model parameters to be used in the structural-acoustic analysis was presented. The FE sound reduction of double-leaf walls using two different stud profiles was then calculated. Experimental tests complying with standards ISO 717-1:1997 and 140-3:1995 were also carried out to evaluate the FE results. It has shown that the stud's shape have significant effects on the sound reduction of the double-leaf walls, and the FE results have similar trends are in fair agreement with the experimental results. A parametric study was conducted and the effects of the stud's shapes on the sound reduction were presented and discussed.},

abstract = {Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems are made of cold-formed steel studs and tracks, and lined with wall lining materials. Conventionally, gypsum plasterboards are used as wall lining material in LSF wall systems. The fire performance of LSF walls is mainly dependent on the type and configuration of wall lining material, which delays the heat transfer through the wall and protects the steel studs from being heated rapidly. Recently, calcium silicate board lining is increasingly used in LSF wall systems because of its improved physical and thermal properties while being lightweight, cost effective, impact and moisture resistant. However, their fire performance has not been investigated in detail. Hence two full scale fire tests were conducted on non-load bearing LSF walls lined with calcium silicate boards. For comparison purposes two fire tests were also conducted on conventional gypsum plasterboard lined LSF walls. This paper presents the details of this experimental study on the fire performance of LSF walls and the results including fire resistance levels and time-temperature profiles across the wall panels. Effects of using calcium silicate board lining are discussed by comparing the fire test results of LSF wall lined with gypsum plasterboards and previously conducted studies on magnesium oxide board lined LSF walls. The results showed that the fire performance of calcium silicate board lined walls was similar to that of conventional gypsum plasterboard lined walls, but was superior to that of magnesium oxide board lined walls. The failure criterion of these calcium silicate board lined walls was found to be insulation as opposed to being the integrity failure observed in previous studies.},

However, coefficients are not available for unlipped channel sections that are normally fastened to supports through their flanges. Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 includes bearing capacity equations for different load cases, but does not distinguish between fastened and unfastened support conditions. Therefore, an experimental study was conducted to determine the bearing capacities of these sections as used in floor systems. Twenty-eight web bearing tests on unlipped channel sections with restrained flanges were conducted under End One Flange (EOF) and Interior One Flange (IOF) load cases. Using the results from this study, a new equation was proposed within the AISI S100 and AS/NZS 4600 guidelines to determine the bearing capacities of cold-formed unlipped channels with flanges fastened to supports.

abstract = {Cold-formed thin-walled steel sections are usually used in planar structural systems with insulation on both sides. Due to their small thickness, when exposed to fire, they dissipate heat to the surrounding quickly, leading to rapid temperature increases. Also because they employ planar fire protection and are usually exposed to fire attack from one side, a significant temperature gradient through the cross-section of a thin-walled member can be induced. A temperature gradient may also be present in the width direction because thin-walled members lose heat rapidly to their surroundings. As a result, temperature distributions in a thin-walled steel section can be highly non-uniform under fire conditions. Furthermore, the thermal performance of the steel section will depend on the presence or otherwise of the protective layers, usually made from gypsum boards, which may not always stick to the steel section due to possible integrity failure. In this study, the thermal performance of thin-walled steel channel sections in a planar system under fire attack from one side has been investigated both experimentally and numerically. In the experimental study, fire tests were conducted on eight steel stud panels with different types of steel section, different number of gypsum boards and either with or without interior insulation. The numerical study was performed by first validating the capabilities of a commercially available general finite element program ABAQUS. Afterwards, ABAQUS was used to carry out a parametric study to investigate the thermal performance of steel stud systems with different numbers of gypsum boards on the exposed and unexposed sides and that of cassette systems. Results of these investigations indicate that the thermal performance of cold-formed thin-walled steel channel wall panels are not significantly affected by the type of interior insulation and the shape of the cold-formed thin-walled steel cross-section. Temperatures of the steel section of a steel stud panel system depend primarily on insulation panels on the fire exposed side. A cassette section, which has a wide web (300–400mm), two flanges and two narrow webs, is an alternative to conventional steel stud to eliminate cross-bracing. The thermal performance of this type of wall system is greatly affected by its layout, i.e. whether the continuous steel sheet is on the fire exposed side or the unexposed side. Temperatures in the steel cassette section are higher if the continuous sheet is on the fire exposed side.},

In addition, they generally only take into account the structural behaviour of members with just one profile. On the contrary, this paper reports a series of flexural tests under fire conditions focused on cold-formed galvanised steel beams consisting on compound cold-formed steel profiles which are often used in floors and roofs of warehouses and industrial buildings. The main objective of this research was to assess the failure modes, the critical temperature and the critical time of the studied beams. Other important goals of this research work were also to investigate the influence of the cross-sections, the axial restraint to the thermal elongation of the beam and the rotational stiffness of the beam supports. Finally, the results showed above all that the critical temperature of a cold-formed steel beam might be strongly affected by the axial restraint to the thermal elongation of the beam. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this study, an analysis of steady-state and unsteady-state Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) of an aeronautic high pressure gas turbine was conducted, which can calculate fluid and solid domain at the same time. ANSYS CFX V16.0 was used to solve the problem. The main emphasis of this study was on three dimensional behavior of the temperature distribution in blade of the 1st stage high pressure turbine. The Conjugate heat transfer approach in this study is validated with 1983 NASA internally cooled C3X experimental data. Results from the unsteady state were compared to the results of steady state calculations. This paper focuses on the need of unsteady conjugate heat transfer analysis of the rotor blade in cooling design process, with the prediction of the thermal environment around the rotor blade and heat conduction in the rotor blade as it is quite important to carry out the thermal load analysis and life assessment of rotor blades.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to explore the significant post-buckling reserve in global buckling that has been observed in tests on cold-formed steel angle columns, and to provide design guidance for locally slender cold-formed steel lipped and plain angle columns with fixed end boundary conditions. Global buckling modes are generally regarded to have no post-buckling reserve, and indeed all column design curves, including those used in North America for cold-formed steel columns limit the strength to 0.877Pcre (where Pcre is the global buckling load) or lower. However, tests conducted on cold-formed steel angles by Young (2004,2005) [1,2] demonstrate capacities significantly in excess of Pcre - an observation usually reserved for local-plate buckling modes, which due to transverse membrane resistance are known to have significant post-buckling reserve. In this work, specific attention is paid to the impact of end boundary conditions, with emphasis on warping (longitudinal) deformations. Utilizing nonlinear collapse analysis with shell finite element models, and existing testing, alternatives to current design methods are explored. New design procedures are recommended for strength prediction of cold-formed steel angle columns with fixed end boundary conditions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems are made of cold-formed steel studs and tracks, and lined with wall lining materials. Conventionally, gypsum plasterboards are used as wall lining material in LSF wall systems. The fire performance of LSF walls is mainly dependent on the type and configuration of wall lining material, which delays the heat transfer through the wall and protects the steel studs from being heated rapidly. Recently, calcium silicate board lining is increasingly used in LSF wall systems because of its improved physical and thermal properties while being lightweight, cost effective, impact and moisture resistant. However, their fire performance has not been investigated in detail. Hence two full scale fire tests were conducted on non-load bearing LSF walls lined with calcium silicate boards. For comparison purposes two fire tests were also conducted on conventional gypsum plasterboard lined LSF walls. This paper presents the details of this experimental study on the fire performance of LSF walls and the results including fire resistance levels and time-temperature profiles across the wall panels. Effects of using calcium silicate board lining are discussed by comparing the fire test results of LSF wall lined with gypsum plasterboards and previously conducted studies on magnesium oxide board lined LSF walls. The results showed that the fire performance of calcium silicate board lined walls was similar to that of conventional gypsum plasterboard lined walls, but was superior to that of magnesium oxide board lined walls. The failure criterion of these calcium silicate board lined walls was found to be insulation as opposed to being the integrity failure observed in previous studies.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the ultimate strength, post-buckling behaviour and design of cold-formed steel lipped channel beams affected by local-distortional buckling mode interaction, subjected to uniform bending of the major axis. The cross-sectional dimensions and length of the beams were chosen to have almost equal local and distortional critical buckling stresses by using the GBTUL-2.0$\beta$ and CUFSM software. The beams are analysed under pinned with warping free end conditions. 12 sections were selected for this study. The selected sections satisfy the geometric limitations for pre-qualified sections in AISI-S100:2007. Elastic buckling and non-linear finite element analyses were carried out using ABAQUS. The results were compared with corresponding results from experiments available in the literature. The numerical parametric study of 60 analyses of different geometries and yield stress values was undertaken. Based on the comparison of ultimate strengths obtained from the finite element analysis and Direct Strength Method (DSM), a design equation is proposed for lipped channel sections which have their elastic local and distortional buckling moments nearly equal.},

abstract = {Mechanical properties have an important role in the fire safety design of cold-formed steel structures due to the rapid reduction in mechanical properties such as yield strength and elastic modulus under fire conditions and associated reduction to the load carrying capacities. Hence there is a need to fully understand the deterioration characteristics of yield strength and elastic modulus of cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures. Although past research has produced useful experimental data on the mechanical properties of cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures, such data do not yet cover different cold-formed steel grades and thicknesses. Therefore, an experimental study was undertaken to investigate the elevated temperature mechanical properties of two low and high strength steels with two thicknesses that are commonly used in Australia. Tensile coupon tests were undertaken using a steady state test method for temperatures in the range 20–700 °C. Test results were compared with the currently available reduction factors for yield strength and elastic modulus, and stress–strain curves, based on which further improvements were made. For this purpose, test results of many other cold-formed steels were also used based on other similar studies undertaken at the Queensland University of Technology. Improved equations were developed to predict the yield strength and elastic modulus reduction factors and stress–strain curves of a range of cold-formed steel grades and thicknesses used in Australia. This paper presents the results of this experimental study, comparisons with the results of past research and steel design standards, and the new predictive equations.},

A non-linear finite element model (FEM) is developed and verified against test results. It is shown that the FEM can accurately predict the bearing strengths and failure modes of the tested specimens. A parametric study on the bearing strengths of 182 single shear bolted connections at 7 different temperatures was performed using the verified FEM. Bearing factors that included the effects of elevated temperatures were proposed for the bearing strengths of single shear bolted connections with and without considering bolt hole deformation. The bearing strengths of single shear bolted connections of thin sheet steels obtained from the tests and finite element analysis (FEA) were compared with the design strengths calculated using the current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications with consideration of the deterioration of material properties at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the proposed bearing factors improved the predictions of the bearing strengths of single shear bolted connections at elevated temperatures than the current design predications. The reliability of the current and proposed design rules was evaluated using reliability analysis.},

abstract = {Lightweight steel-framed (LSF) construction, given its advantages, has the potential to reach high standards in energy and environmental performance of buildings, such as nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEB). When compared with traditional construction, LSF system offers distinct benefits in such fields as sustainability, cost-effectiveness, constructive process, and safety at work. Despite the benefits of this constructive system, the effect of thermal bridges in LSF elements, caused by the high thermal conductivity of the steel structure, can be a disadvantage. The excessive heat losses or gains through these thermal bridges are more relevant in buildings' exterior envelope, such as facade walls. These building components' thermal performance is crucial in the buildings' overall energetic behaviour, with a direct impact on energy consumption and resulting monetary costs during their operational stage. In this work the influence of the thermal insulation position on its effectiveness is evaluated in LSF facade walls. For this purpose, several LSF wall types are assessed, namely cold, warm, and hybrid construction. The influence of thermal bridges instigated by the steel studs in the LSF walls' overall thermal performance is evaluated as well. The computations are performed using specialized finite element software (THERM).},

abstract = {The paper describes the numerical simulations required to estimate the performance of a composite slab using a re-entrant profiled steel sheet, prior to conducting a loaded fire test to verify the performance predicted by the simulations and obtain a fire rating according to accepted international standards. The purpose of the simulations was to optimise the design of the composite slab, by eliminating unnecessary reinforcement bars. Heat transfer analysis involving convection, conduction and boundary radiation was undertaken on a detailed solid modelled slab as part of a new steel-concrete slab product development. The simulation accounted for the thermal contact resistance at the cold-formed steel-concrete interface. The novelties of the model to incorporate the temperature dependent formulation of the interface thermal conductance provided a realistic prediction of the cross-sectional temperature field, which matched the fire test measurements. The slab top surface temperatures were assessed according to EN 1363-1:2012 to enable comparisons to be made with the insulation performance criteria. Following the uncoupled heat transfer analysis, the temperatures calculated through the thickness were used as an input into a sequentially coupled thermal-stress analysis of an equivalent shell modelled slab. This was necessary due to the excessive computing time required for the detailed solid modelled concrete slab that was used for the heat transfer analysis. Nevertheless, the calibrated shell that represented the composite slab model accounted for the dissimilar temperature-time (T-t) curves through the slab depth, since the bottom surface, close to the fire source, heats up at a much higher rate than the top surface. From the explicit-quasi static simulation, the load bearing capacity was calculated, which is expressed by the limiting largest deflection and deflection rate for flexural loaded structural members as given in EN 1363-1:2012. From these analyses, it was found that the overall fire resistance was limited by the load bearing capacity criteria. The predicted insulation and load bearing capacity compared very favourably with the fire test measurements, which are also presented in this paper, and provides confidence in the methodology used in this study.

abstract = {In the residential sector single stud LSF walls are commonly used as load bearing and non-load bearing walls. But in situations where higher acoustic insulation levels and load bearing capacities are required, double stud LSF walls are used. However, fire performance of double stud LSF walls has not been investigated adequately unlike in the case of single stud LSF walls. There is insufficient research data on the fire performance of double stud wall systems. Therefore, this research investigated the fire performance of double stud walls under standard fire conditions using full scale test panels (3 m × 3 m)made of 90 mm lipped channel studs. Three full-scale fire tests were conducted to investigate the fire performance of load bearing double stud LSF walls. The fire test results of double stud LSF walls were then compared with those of single stud LSF walls with varying stud depth. The results revealed the presence of a unique heat transfer mechanism, resulting in an enhanced fire performance for double stud walls. The discontinuous stud arrangement within the cavity of double stud LSF walls was identified as the main contributor for the delayed heat transfer mechanism. This paper presents the details of this research and its results. It has also shown that the Direct Strength Method (DSM)based fire design equations developed for single stud LSF walls can be used to predict the failure times of double stud LSF walls exposed to fire.},

abstract = {This analysis focuses on the importance of accurate description of walls' thermal behavior with particular relevance to fire safety cases. To accurately predict thermal loads on the walls in a complex fire situation, time dependent phenomena of thermal convection, diffusion, radiation, and heat transfer across the wall have to be taken into account. The heat transfer across the walls is often neglected as it requires fine grid resolution to approximate large temperature gradients. The analysis shows that this can lead to substantial errors and proposes a transient semi-analytical approximation of thermal wall behavior. Unsteady heat diffusion equation is solved by semi-analytical approximation of a temperature profile in a wall. The temperature profile is approximated in each time step and for each wall grid node separately using the temperature at the wall internal side and Biot number at the external side for boundary conditions. Wall heat transfer coefficient is calculated as a temperature profile derivative and then used in the coupled numerical model of the fire. The semi-analytical approach does not rely on a discretization procedure and the accuracy of its solutions is independent of grid spacing. Therefore, such semianalytical technique is computationally less expensive and especially attractive for long transient calculations.},

abstract = {At present, fire-resistant boards have become the most common fire protection productions in cold-formed steel (CFS) structures. In this paper, a fire experimental investigation of 12 CFS composite assemblies is carried out and the effects of different boards and insulation material are discussed. For non-load-bearing CFS composite assemblies lined with only GP board on the fire side, significant flexural deflection of CFS frame towards the furnace and local buckling of steel web is observed, due to the thermal bowing and fall off of fire-side GP board. Compared to the GP board, the low-bulk-density calcium-silicate (CS) board is not prone to fall off during the fire exposure. Replacing the fire-side base-layer GP board with CS board generates an effective fire protection on the cavity and ambient-side of assemblies. Therefore, the buckling of steel frame becomes insignificant and the testing fire resistance time of insulation failure is extended by 9 min to 46 min. The thermal insulation performance of aluminum silicate wool is obviously superior to that of rock wool in fire. For the present assemblies using aluminum silicate wool as external insulation instead of rock wool, the fire resistance time of insulation failure is extended by 18 min. Meanwhile, the composite panel and autoclaved lightweight concrete (ALC) board display excellent thermal insulation performance. For the CFS assemblies using aluminum silicate wool as external insulation, GP and CS boards as fire-side composite panel and ALC board as ambient-side base-layer sheathing, the fire resistance time of insulation failure becomes more than 171 min.},

abstract = {Cold-formed profiled steel roof sheeting can be directly connected to the top chord of a steel roof truss through self-tapping screws. At ambient temperatures, neither EN 1993-1-8 nor EN 1993-1-3 can be used directly for this type of connection. Besides, no design rules are available in EN 1993-1-2 for designing screwed connections in fire. A 3D Finite Element (FE) model for a single-lap shear screwed connection is developed using ABAQUS software. After the validation by tests, the model is used to predict the ultimate resistance of connections at both ambient and elevated temperatures. Further, the effects of edge and end distances on the connection resistance are investigated. Based on the analyses results, revised design equations for predicting the connection resistance are proposed. The design resistance is calibrated by testing and FE analyses results according to the procedure given in EN 1990 and the partial safety factor is derived.},

@article{Beyler2007,
abstract = {The ASTM E119 test procedure (or equivalent) is used to determine whether a construction assembly or structural element meets the fire resistance rating requirements specified in prescriptive building codes. Fire statistics indicate that these requirements appear to be adequate in meeting the intended fire safety objectives of the prescriptive codes. In recent years it has become more common to design buildings for fire safety on a performance basis. The standard fire resistance test in its present form is not designed to provide discrete information that can be used in support of performance-based structural fire design. The technology of the test standard could be improved to make the measurements and results more useful for performance-based fire design. This report presents the results of a study undertaken by the Foundation to develop the technical basis for changes and additions to ASTM E119 so that measurements and results can be used in performance-based design, without compromising the traditional use of the test standard for prescriptive building code compliance. The Research Foundation expresses gratitude to the report authors Craig Beyler, Jesse Beitel, Nestor Iwankiw, and Brian Lattimer of Hughes Associates, Inc.; and the Project Technical Panelists and Principal Sponsors listed on the following page.

abstract = {The development of the slotted steel stud made it possible to use steel in external walls in countries with cold climate, like Sweden. By slotting the web the thermal bridges are significantly reduced. Several fabricators of lightweight constructions in Scandinavia now have slotted studs in their range, intended for load-bearing external walls in single family houses and for infill walls in blocks of flats. The development of the slotted stud has also led to the development of the building system for residential called Light Steel Framing. This paper mainly considers design methods for slotted steel studs for external walls. The importance of the slotted stud for the Light Steel Framing System is lighten up by a description of building components as exterior walls, interior walls and light weight floor structures. The thermal properties, sound insulation, springiness and vibrations, fire proof are described as well as building services, architecture, planning and production.},
